## JpegImage.DestinationCmykColorProfile property

The CMYK color profile is vital for the accurate color conversion of CMYK and YCCK JPEG images during the saving process. It works in tandem with the RGBColorProfile to ensure correct color representation, maintaining consistency and quality across different devices and software. This synchronization is crucial for achieving accurate and reliable color rendering in the final saved images.

```csharp
public StreamSource DestinationCmykColorProfile { get; set; }
```
