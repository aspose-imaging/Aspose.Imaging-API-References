Gets or sets the tension A 32-bit floating point number that specifies how tightly the spline bends as it passes through the points. A value of 0 specifies that the spline is a sequence of straight lines. As the value increases, the curve becomes more rounded. For more information, see [SPLINE77] and [PETZOLD].
