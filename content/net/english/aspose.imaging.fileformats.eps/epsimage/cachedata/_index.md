## EpsImage.CacheData method

This method does nothing as the current implementation of the [`EpsImage`](../../epsimage) class does not involve caching data. While it may not perform any action, understanding this behavior is crucial for developers working with EPS images, ensuring efficient resource management and optimal performance within their applications.

```csharp
public override void CacheData()
```
