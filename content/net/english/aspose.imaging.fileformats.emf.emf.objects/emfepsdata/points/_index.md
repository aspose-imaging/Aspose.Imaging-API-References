## EmfEpsData.Points property

Gets or sets an array of three Point28_4 objects (section 2.2.23) that defines the coordinates of the output parallelogram using 28.4 bit FIX notation

```csharp
public EmfPoint28To4[] Points { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The upper-left corner of the parallelogram is the first point in this array, the upper-right corner is the second point, and the lower-left corner is the third point. The lower-right corner of the parallelogram is computed from the first three points (A, B, and C) by treating them as vectors.
