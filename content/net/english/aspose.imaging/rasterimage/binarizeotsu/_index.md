## RasterImage.BinarizeOtsu method

Binarization of an image with Otsu thresholding

```csharp
[C#]

string dir = "c:\\temp\\";

using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load(dir + "sample.png"))
{
    Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage rasterImage = (Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage)image;

    // Binarize the image with Otsu thresholding.
    rasterImage.BinarizeOtsu();
    rasterImage.Save(dir + "sample.BinarizeOtsu.png");
}
```
