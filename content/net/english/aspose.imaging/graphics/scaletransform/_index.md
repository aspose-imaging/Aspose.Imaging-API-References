## Graphics.ScaleTransform method (1 of 2)

Scales the local geometric transform by the specified amounts. This method prepends the scaling matrix to the transform.

```csharp
public void ScaleTransform(float sx, float sy)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sx | Single | The amount by which to scale the transform in the x-axis direction. |
| sy | Single | The amount by which to scale the transform in the y-axis direction. |

## Graphics.ScaleTransform method (2 of 2)

Scales the local geometric transform by the specified amounts in the specified order.

```csharp
public void ScaleTransform(float sx, float sy, MatrixOrder order)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sx | Single | The amount by which to scale the transform in the x-axis direction. |
| sy | Single | The amount by which to scale the transform in the y-axis direction. |
| order | MatrixOrder | A [`MatrixOrder`](../../matrixorder) that specifies whether to append or prepend the scaling matrix. |
