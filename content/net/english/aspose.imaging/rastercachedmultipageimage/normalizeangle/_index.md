## RasterCachedMultipageImage.NormalizeAngle method

Normalizes the angle. This method is applicable to scanned text documents to get rid of the skewed scan. This method uses [`GetSkewAngle`](../../rasterimage/getskewangle) and [`Rotate`](../rotate) methods.

```csharp
public override void NormalizeAngle(bool resizeProportionally, Color backgroundColor)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| resizeProportionally | Boolean | if set to `true` you will have your image size changed according to rotated rectangle (corner points) projections in other case that leaves dimensions untouched and only internal image contents are rotated. |
| backgroundColor | Color | Color of the background. |
