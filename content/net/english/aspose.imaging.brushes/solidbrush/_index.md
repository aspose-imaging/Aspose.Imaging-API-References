## SolidBrush class

Solid brush is intended for drawing continiously with specific color. This class cannot be inherited.

```csharp
public sealed class SolidBrush : Brush
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SolidBrush](solidbrush)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`SolidBrush`](../solidbrush) class. |
| [SolidBrush](solidbrush)(Color) | Initializes a new instance of the [`SolidBrush`](../solidbrush) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Color](../../aspose.imaging.brushes/solidbrush/color) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the brush color. |
| [Disposed](../../aspose.imaging/disposableobject/disposed) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this instance is disposed. |
| [Opacity](../../aspose.imaging/brush/opacity) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the brush opacity. The value should be between 0 and 1. Value of 0 means that brush is fully visible, value of 1 means the brush is fully opaque. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| virtual [DeepClone](../../aspose.imaging/brush/deepclone)() | Creates a new deep clone of the current [`Brush`](../../aspose.imaging/brush). |
| [Dispose](../../aspose.imaging/disposableobject/dispose)() | Disposes the current instance. |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.imaging/brush/equals)(object) | Check if objects are equal. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.imaging/brush/gethashcode)() | Get hash code of the current object. |

### Examples

This example uses Graphics class to create primitive shapes on the Image surface. To demonstrate the operation, the example creates a new Image in PNG format and draw primitive shapes on Image surface using Draw methods exposed by Graphics class

```csharp
[C#]

//Creates an instance of FileStream
using (System.IO.FileStream stream = new System.IO.FileStream(@"C:\temp\output.png", System.IO.FileMode.Create))
{
    //Create an instance of PngOptions and set its various properties
    Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.PngOptions pngOptions = new Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.PngOptions();

    //Set the Source for PngOptions
    pngOptions.Source = new Aspose.Imaging.Sources.StreamSource(stream);

    //Create an instance of Image 
    using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Create(pngOptions, 500, 500))
    {
        //Create and initialize an instance of Graphics class
        Aspose.Imaging.Graphics graphics = new Aspose.Imaging.Graphics(image);

        //Clear Graphics surface
        graphics.Clear(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Wheat);

        //Draw an Arc by specifying the Pen object having Black color, 
        //a Rectangle surrounding the Arc, Start Angle and Sweep Angle
        graphics.DrawArc(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Black, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(200, 200, 100, 200), 0, 300);

        //Draw a Bezier by specifying the Pen object having Blue color and co-ordinate Points.
        graphics.DrawBezier(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Blue, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(250, 100), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(300, 30), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(450, 100), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(235, 25));

        //Draw a Curve by specifying the Pen object having Green color and an array of Points
        graphics.DrawCurve(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Green, 2), new[] { new Aspose.Imaging.Point(100, 200), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(100, 350), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(200, 450) });

        //Draw an Ellipse using the Pen object and a surrounding Rectangle
        graphics.DrawEllipse(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Yellow, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(300, 300, 100, 100));

        //Draw a Line 
        graphics.DrawLine(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Violet, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(100, 100), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(200, 200));

        //Draw a Pie segment
        graphics.DrawPie(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Silver, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Point(200, 20), new Aspose.Imaging.Size(200, 200)), 0, 45);

        //Draw a Polygon by specifying the Pen object having Red color and an array of Points
        graphics.DrawPolygon(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Red, 2), new[] { new Aspose.Imaging.Point(20, 100), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(20, 200), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(220, 20) });

        //Draw a Rectangle
        graphics.DrawRectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Orange, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Point(250, 250), new Aspose.Imaging.Size(100, 100)));

        //Create a SolidBrush object and set its various properties
        Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.SolidBrush brush = new Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.SolidBrush();
        brush.Color = Color.Purple;
        brush.Opacity = 100;

        //Draw a String using the SolidBrush object and Font, at specific Point
        graphics.DrawString("This image is created by Aspose.Imaging API", new Aspose.Imaging.Font("Times New Roman", 16), brush, new Aspose.Imaging.PointF(50, 400));

        // save all changes.
        image.Save();
    }
}
```
