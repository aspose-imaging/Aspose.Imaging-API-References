## EmfPlusCustomLineCapArrowData.LineJoin property

Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the value in the LineJoin enumeration that specifies how to join two lines that are drawn by the same pen and whose ends meet. At the intersection of the two line ends, a line join makes the connection look more continuous.

```csharp
public EmfPlusLineJoinType LineJoin { get; set; }
```
