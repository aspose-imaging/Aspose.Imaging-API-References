This value MUST be in the range -100 through 100, with effects as follows: -100 ≤ value &lt; 0 As the value decreases, the amount of green in the image SHOULD decrease and the amount of magenta SHOULD increase. 0 A value of 0 specifies that the amounts of green and magenta MUST NOT change. 0 &lt; value ≤ 100 As the value increases, the amount of green in the image SHOULD increase and the amount of magenta SHOULD decrease.

public int MagentaGreen { get; set; }
```
