## GifImage.GetOriginalOptions method

Retrieve the original file settings-based options, crucial for maintaining fidelity and consistency in image processing and manipulation. This method allows seamless integration of file-specific parameters into subsequent operations, ensuring accurate rendition and adherence to the image's inherent characteristics. This can be helpful to keep bit-depth and other parameters of the original image unchanged. For example, if we load a black-white PNG image with 1 bit per pixel and then save it using the [`Save`](../../../aspose.imaging/datastreamsupporter/save) method, the output PNG image with 8-bit per pixel will be produced. To avoid it and save PNG image with 1-bit per pixel, use this method to get corresponding saving options and pass them to the [`Save`](../../../aspose.imaging/image/save) method as the second parameter.

```csharp
public override ImageOptionsBase GetOriginalOptions()
```

### Return Value

The options based on the original file settings.
