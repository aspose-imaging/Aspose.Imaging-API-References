### EmfGradientTriangle() {#EmfGradientTriangle--}
```
public EmfGradientTriangle()
```


### getVertex1() {#getVertex1--}
```
public int getVertex1()
```


Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of the EMR\_GRADIENTFILL record.

**Returns:**
int
### setVertex1(int value) {#setVertex1-int-}
```
public void setVertex1(int value)
```


Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of the EMR\_GRADIENTFILL record.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | int |  |

### getVertex2() {#getVertex2--}
```
public int getVertex2()
```


Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of the EMR\_GRADIENTFILL record.

**Returns:**
int
### setVertex2(int value) {#setVertex2-int-}
```
public void setVertex2(int value)
```


Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of the EMR\_GRADIENTFILL record.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| value | int |  |

### getVertex3() {#getVertex3--}
```
public int getVertex3()
```


Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of the EMR\_GRADIENTFILL record.

**Returns:**
int
### setVertex3(int value) {#setVertex3-int-}
```
public void setVertex3(int value)
```


Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of the EMR\_GRADIENTFILL record.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
