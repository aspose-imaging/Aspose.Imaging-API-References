The PitchFont enumeration defines values that are used for specifying characteristics of a font. The values are used to indicate whether the characters in a font have a fixed or variable width, or pitch.
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DEFAULT_PITCH](#DEFAULT-PITCH) | The default pitch, which is implementation-dependent. |
| [FIXED_PITCH](#FIXED-PITCH) | A fixed pitch, which means that all the characters in the font occupy the same width when output in a string. |
| [VARIABLE_PITCH](#VARIABLE-PITCH) | A variable pitch, which means that the characters in the font occupy widths that are proportional to the actual widths of the glyphs when output in a string. |
### DEFAULT_PITCH {#DEFAULT-PITCH}
```
public static final byte DEFAULT_PITCH
```


The default pitch, which is implementation-dependent.

### FIXED_PITCH {#FIXED-PITCH}
```
public static final byte FIXED_PITCH
```


A fixed pitch, which means that all the characters in the font occupy the same width when output in a string.

### VARIABLE_PITCH {#VARIABLE-PITCH}
```
public static final byte VARIABLE_PITCH
```


A variable pitch, which means that the characters in the font occupy widths that are proportional to the actual widths of the glyphs when output in a string. For example, the "i" and space characters usually have much smaller widths than a "W" or "O" character.
