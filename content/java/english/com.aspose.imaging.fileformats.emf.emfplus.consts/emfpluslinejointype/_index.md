The LineJoinType enumeration defines ways to join two lines that are drawn by the same graphics pen and whose ends meet.

--------------------

Graphics lines are specified by [EmfPlusPen](../../com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.objects/emfpluspen) objects (section 2.2.1.7). A line join makes the intersection of the two line ends look more continuous.
