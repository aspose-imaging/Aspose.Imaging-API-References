The StringAlignment enumeration defines ways to align strings with respect to a text layout rectangle.
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [StringAlignmentNear](#StringAlignmentNear) | Specifies that string alignment is toward the origin of the layout rectangle. |
| [StringAlignmentCenter](#StringAlignmentCenter) | Specifies that alignment is centered between the origin and extent of the layout rectangle. |
| [StringAlignmentFar](#StringAlignmentFar) | Specifies that alignment is to the right side of the layout rectangle. |
### StringAlignmentNear {#StringAlignmentNear}
```
public static final int StringAlignmentNear
```


Specifies that string alignment is toward the origin of the layout rectangle. This can be used to align characters along a line or to align text within a rectangle. For a right-to-left layout rectangle, the origin SHOULD be at the upper right.

### StringAlignmentCenter {#StringAlignmentCenter}
```
public static final int StringAlignmentCenter
```


Specifies that alignment is centered between the origin and extent of the layout rectangle.

### StringAlignmentFar {#StringAlignmentFar}
```
public static final int StringAlignmentFar
```


Specifies that alignment is to the right side of the layout rectangle.
