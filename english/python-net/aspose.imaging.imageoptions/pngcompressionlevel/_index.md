The png compression level enum.

**Module:** [aspose.imaging.imageoptions](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.imageoptions/)

**Full Name:** aspose.imaging.imageoptions.PngCompressionLevel

## **Members**
| **Member name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| DEFLATE_RECOMENDED | The most optimised compression, with a good balance of speed and compression efficiency.<br/>            Uses a faster deflate implementation with no compression scale. |
| ZIP_LEVEL0 | The data will be simply stored, with no change at all.<br/>            Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZIP_LEVEL1 | The fastest but least effective compression.<br/>            Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZIP_LEVEL2 | A little slower, but better, than level 1.<br/>            Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZIP_LEVEL3 | A little slower, but better, than level 2.<br/>            Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZIP_LEVEL4 | A little slower, but better, than level 3.<br/>            Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZIP_LEVEL5 | A little slower than level 4, but with better compression.<br/>            Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZIP_LEVEL6 | A little slower than level 5, but with better compression.<br/>            Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZIP_LEVEL7 | Better compression than level 6, but even slower.<br/>            Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZIP_LEVEL8 | Better compression than level 7, but even slower.<br/>            Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZIP_LEVEL9 | The "best" compression, where best means greatest reduction in size of the input data stream. <br/>            This is also the slowest compression.<br/>            Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
