The EmfPlusCustomLineCapArrowData object specifies adjustable arrow data for a custom line cap.

**Namespace:** [aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.objects](/imaging/python-net/api-reference/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.objects/)

**Full Class Name:** aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.objects.EmfPlusCustomLineCapArrowData

**Assembly:**  Aspose.Imaging Version: 23.3.0

The EmfPlusCustomLineCapArrowData type exposes the following members:
## **Constructors**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|EmfPlusCustomLineCapArrowData()|Initializes a new instance of the EmfPlusCustomLineCapArrowData class|
## **Properties**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|width|Gets or sets a 32-bit floating-point value that specifies <br/>            the width of the arrow cap|
|height|Gets or sets a 32-bit floating-point value that specifies <br/>            the height of the arrow cap.|
|middle_inset|Gets or sets a 32-bit floating-point value that specifies the number of pixels between the outline of the arrow<br/>             cap and the fill of the arrow cap.|
|fill_state|Gets or sets a 32-bit Boolean value that specifies whether the arrow cap is filled. If the arrow cap is <br/>            not filled, only the outline is drawn|
|line_start_cap|Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the value in the LineCap enumeration that indicates the line cap to <br/>            be used at the start of the line to be drawn|
|line_end_cap|Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the value in the LineCap enumeration that indicates the line cap to <br/>            be used at the end of the line to be drawn|
|line_join|Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the value in the LineJoin <br/>            enumeration that specifies how to join two lines that are drawn by <br/>            the same pen and whose ends meet. At the intersection of the two line ends, <br/>            a line join makes the connection look more continuous.|
|line_miter_limit|Gets or sets a 32-bit floating-point value that specifies the limit of the<br/>             thickness of the join on a mitered corner by setting <br/>            the maximum allowed ratio of miter length to line width|
|width_scale|Gets or sets a 32-bit floating-point value that specifies the amount by <br/>            which to scale an EmfPlusCustomLineCap object with respect to the width <br/>            of the graphics pen that is used to draw the lines|
|fill_hot_spot|Gets or sets EmfPlusPointF object that is not currently used. It MUST be set to {0.0, 0.0}.|
|line_hot_spot|Gets or sets an EmfPlusPointF object that is not currently used. It MUST be set to {0.0, 0.0}.|
