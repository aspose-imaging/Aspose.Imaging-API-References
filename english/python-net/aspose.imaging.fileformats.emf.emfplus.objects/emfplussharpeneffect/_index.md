The SharpenEffect object specifies an increase in the difference in intensity between pixels in an image.

**Namespace:** [aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.objects](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.objects/)

**Full Class Name:** aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.objects.EmfPlusSharpenEffect

**Assembly:**  Aspose.Imaging Version: 23.5.6

The EmfPlusSharpenEffect type exposes the following members:
## **Constructors**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|EmfPlusSharpenEffect()|Initializes a new instance of the EmfPlusSharpenEffect class|
## **Properties**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|radius|Gets or sets A 32-bit floating-point number that specifies the sharpening radius in pixels,<br/>            which determines the number of pixels involved in calculating the new value of a given pixel.<br/>            As this value increases, the number of pixels involved in the calculation increases, and the<br/>            resulting bitmap SHOULD become sharper.|
|amount|Gets or sets A 32-bit floating-point number that specifies the difference in intensity<br/>            between a given pixel and the surrounding pixels.<br/>            0 Specifies that sharpening MUST NOT be performed.<br/>            0 < value â‰¤ 100<br/>            As this value increases, the difference in intensity between pixels SHOULD<br/>            increase.|
