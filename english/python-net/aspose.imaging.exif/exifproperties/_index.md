## **Members**
| **Member name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| APERTURE_VALUE | The lens aperture value. |
| ARTIST | This tag records the name of the camera owner, photographer or image creator. The detailed format is not specified, but it is recommended that the information be written as in the example below for ease of Interoperability. When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown. Ex.) "Camera owner, John Smith; Photographer, Michael Brown; Image creator, Ken James" |
| BITS_PER_SAMPLE | The number of bits per image component. In this standard each component of the image is 8 bits, so the value for this tag is 8. |
| BODY_SERIAL_NUMBER | Contains camera body serial number |
| BRIGHTNESS_VALUE | The brightness value. |
| CAMERA_OWNER_NAME | Contains camera owner name |
| CFA_PATTERN | Indicates the color filter array (CFA) geometric pattern of the image sensor when a one-chip color area sensor is used. It does not apply to all sensing methods. |
| COLOR_SPACE | The color space information tag (ColorSpace) is always recorded as the color space specifier. |
| COMPONENTS_CONFIGURATION | The components configuration. |
| COMPRESSED_BITS_PER_PIXEL | Specific to compressed data; states the compressed bits per pixel. |
| COMPRESSION | The compression scheme used for the image data. When a primary image is JPEG compressed, this designation is not necessary and is omitted. |
| CONTRAST | This tag indicates the direction of contrast processing applied by the camera when the image was shot. |
| COPYRIGHT | Copyright information. In this standard the tag is used to<br/>                indicate both the photographer and editor copyrights. It is<br/>                the copyright notice of the person or organization claiming<br/>                rights to the image. The Interoperability copyright<br/>                statement including date and rights should be written in this<br/>                field; e.g., "Copyright, John Smith, 19xx. All rights<br/>                reserved.". In this standard the field records both the<br/>                photographer and editor copyrights, with each recorded in a<br/>                separate part of the statement. When there is a clear distinction<br/>                between the photographer and editor copyrights, these are to be<br/>                written in the order of photographer followed by editor copyright,<br/>                separated by NULL (in this case since the statement also ends with<br/>                a NULL, there are two NULL codes). When only the photographer<br/>                copyright is given, it is terminated by one NULL code . When only<br/>                the editor copyright is given, the photographer copyright part<br/>                consists of one space followed by a terminating NULL code, then<br/>                the editor copyright is given. When the field is left blank, it is<br/>                treated as unknown. |
