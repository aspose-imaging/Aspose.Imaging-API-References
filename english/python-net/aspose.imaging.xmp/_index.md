The module contains XMP related helper classes and methods.

## **Classes**
| **Class** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [IXmlValue](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/ixmlvalue/) | Converts xmp values to the XML string representation. |
| [LangAlt](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/langalt/) | Represents XMP Language Alternative. |
| [Namespaces](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/namespaces/) | Contains namespaces used in RDF document. |
| [XmpArray](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmparray/) | Represents Xmp Array in [XmpPackage](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmppackage/). TODO: Array may contain complex data. |
| [XmpArrayHelper](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmparrayhelper/) | The helper class for processing RDF logic |
| [XmpElementBase](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmpelementbase/) | Represents base xmp element contains attributes. |
| [XmpHeaderPi](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmpheaderpi/) | Represents XMP header processing instruction. |
| [XmpMeta](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmpmeta/) | Represents xmpmeta. Optional.<br/>            The purpose of this element is to identify XMP metadata within general XML text that might contain other non-XMP uses of RDF. |
| [XmpPackage](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmppackage/) | Represents base abstraction for XMP package. |
| [XmpPackageBaseCollection](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmppackagebasecollection/) | Represents collection of [XmpPackage](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmppackage/). |
| [XmpPacketWrapper](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmppacketwrapper/) | Contains serialized xmp package including header and trailer. |
| [XmpRdfRoot](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmprdfroot/) | Represents rdf:RDF element.<br/>            A single XMP packet shall be serialized using a single rdf:RDF XML element. The rdf:RDF element content shall consist of only zero or more rdf:Description elements. |
| [XmpTrailerPi](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmptrailerpi/) | Represents XMP trailer processing instruction. |
## **Enumerations**
| **Enumeration** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [XmpArrayType](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmparraytype/) | Represents array type in [XmpArray](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.xmp/xmparray/). |
