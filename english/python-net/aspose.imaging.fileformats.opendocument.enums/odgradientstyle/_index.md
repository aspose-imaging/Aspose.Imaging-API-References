| AXIAL | The axial<br/>                defines a bi-linear gradient that is also known as reflected gradient or mirrored linear gradient.<br/>                It is created as a linear gradient that is mirrored (or reflected) along its axis. |
| ELLIPSOID | The ellipsoid<br/>                defines a gradient where the colors are blend along the radius from the center of an<br/>                ellipsoid as defined with the draw:cx and draw:cy attributes.<br/>                The length of the semi major-axis is the width of the filled area and the length of the semi-minor |
| LINEAR | The linear<br/>                defines a gradient where the colors blend along the linear axis of the gradient.<br/>                The axis of the gradient is specified with the draw:angle attribute clockwise to the vertical axis. |
| NONE | The gradient style is none |
| RADIAL | The radial<br/>                defines a gradient where the colors are blend along the radius from the center<br/>                of a circle as defined with the draw:cx and draw:cy attributes.<br/>                The outside of the circle is filled with the end color. |
| RECTANGLE | The rectangle<br/>                defines a gradient that produces a rectangular blend from the center of the rectangle to the shortest<br/>                of the 4 borders. The center of the rectangle is defined with the attributes draw:cx and draw:cy.<br/>                The width of the rectangle is the width of the filled area,<br/>                the height of the rectangle is the height of the filled area.<br/>                The outside of the square is filled with the end color. |
| SQUARE | The square<br/>                defines a gradient that produces a square blend, imitating the visual perspective in a corridor or the<br/>                aerial view of a pyramid.<br/>                Also known as "box gradient" and "pyramidal gradient".<br/>                The center of the square is defined with the draw:cx and draw:cy attributes.<br/>                The width and height of the square is the minimum value of either the width or the height of the filled area.<br/>                The outside of the square is filled with the end color. |
