The GradientTriangle object defines a triangle using TriVertex objects (section 2.2.26) in an <br/>            EMR_GRADIENTFILL record (section 2.3.5.12)

**Namespace:** [aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects](/imaging/python-net/api-reference/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects/)

**Full Class Name:** aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects.EmfGradientTriangle

**Assembly:**  Aspose.Imaging Version: 23.3.0

The EmfGradientTriangle type exposes the following members:
## **Constructors**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|EmfGradientTriangle()|Initializes a new instance of the EmfGradientTriangle class|
## **Properties**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|vertex1|Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a <br/>            triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of <br/>            the EMR_GRADIENTFILL record.|
|vertex2|Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a <br/>            triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of <br/>            the EMR_GRADIENTFILL record.|
|vertex3|Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a <br/>            triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of <br/>            the EMR_GRADIENTFILL record.|
