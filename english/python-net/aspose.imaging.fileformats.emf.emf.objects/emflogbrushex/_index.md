## **Properties**
| **Name** | **Type** | **Access** | **Description** |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| argb_32_color_ref | int | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit WMF ColorRef object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.8) that specifies a<br/>            color. The interpretation of this field depends on the value of BrushStyle, as explained in the<br/>            following table. |
| brush_hatch | [EmfHatchStyle](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.consts/emfhatchstyle/) | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned field that contains the brush hatch data. Its <br/>            interpretation depends on the value of BrushStyle, |
