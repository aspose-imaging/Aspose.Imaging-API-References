The EmrText object contains values for text output.

**Namespace:** [aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects](/imaging/python-net/api-reference/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects/)

**Full Class Name:** aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects.EmfText

**Assembly:**  Aspose.Imaging Version: 23.3.0

The EmfText type exposes the following members:
## **Constructors**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|EmfText()|Initializes a new instance of the EmfText class|
## **Properties**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|reference|Gets or sets a WMF PointL object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.15) that specifies the coordinates of the <br/>            reference point used to position the string. The reference point is defined by the last <br/>            EMR_SETTEXTALIGN record (section 2.3.11.25). If no such record has been set, <br/>            the default alignment is TA_LEFT,TA_TOP.|
|chars|Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of characters in the string|
|options|Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies how to use the rectangle specified in the <br/>            Rectangle field. This field can be a combination of more than one ExtTextOutOptions <br/>            enumeration (section 2.1.11) values|
|rectangle|Gets or sets an optional WMF RectL object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.19) that defines a clipping <br/>            and/or opaquing rectangle in logical units. This rectangle is applied to the text <br/>            output performed by the containing record.|
|string_buffer|Gets or sets the character string buffer<br/>            UndefinedSpace1 (variable): An optional number of unused bytes. <br/>            The OutputString field is not required to follow immediately the preceding portion of this structure.<br/>            OutputString (variable): An array of characters that specify the string to output. <br/>            The location of this field is specified by the value of offString in bytes from the start of this record. <br/>            The number of characters is specified by the value of Chars.|
|glyph_index_buffer|Gets or sets the optional glyph index buffer.<br/>            If options has ETO_GLYPH_INDEX flag then the codes for characters in an output text string are actually indexes<br/>            of the character glyphs in a TrueType font (2.1.11 ExtTextOutOptions enumeration). Glyph indexes are font-specific,<br/>            so to display the correct characters on playback, the font that is used MUST be identical to the font used to<br/>            generate the indexes.|
|dx_buffer|Gets or sets the optional character spacing buffer<br/>            UndefinedSpace2 (variable): An optional number of unused bytes. The OutputDx field is not required to <br/>            follow immediately the preceding portion of this structure.<br/>            OutputDx (variable): An array of 32-bit unsigned integers that specify the output spacing between <br/>            the origins of adjacent character cells in logical units. The location of this field is specified by <br/>            the value of offDx in bytes from the start of this record. If spacing is defined, this field contains <br/>            the same number of values as characters in the output string. If the Options field of the EmrText object <br/>            contains the ETO_PDY flag, then this buffer contains twice as many values as there are characters in <br/>            the output string, one horizontal and one vertical offset for each, in that order. If ETO_RTLREADING is specified, <br/>            characters are laid right to left instead of left to right. No other options affect the interpretation of this field.|
