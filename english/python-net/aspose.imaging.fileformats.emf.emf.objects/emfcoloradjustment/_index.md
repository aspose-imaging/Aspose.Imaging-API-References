**Full Name:** aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects.EmfColorAdjustment

**Inheritance:** EmfObject

**Aspose.Imaging Version:** 23.10.0

## **Properties**
| **Name** | **Type** | **Access** | **Description** |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| blue_gamma | short | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the nth power gamma correction value for the <br/>            blue primary of the source colors. This value SHOULD be in the range from 2,500 to 65,000. <br/>            A value of 10,000 means gamma correction MUST NOT be performed. |
| brightness | short | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit signed integer that specifies the amount of brightness to be applied to the source object. <br/>            This value SHOULD be in the range from –100 to 100.<br/>            A value of zero means brightness adjustment MUST NOT be performed. |
| colorfullness | short | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit signed integer that specifies the amount of colorfulness to be applied to the source object. <br/>            This value SHOULD be in the range from –100 to 100. <br/>            A value of zero means colorfulness adjustment MUST NOT be performed |
| contrast | short | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit signed integer that specifies the amount of contrast to be applied to the source object. <br/>            This value SHOULD be in the range from –100 to 100. A value of zero means contrast adjustment MUST NOT be performed. |
| green_gamma | short | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the nth power gamma correction value for the green <br/>            primary of the source colors. This value SHOULD be in the range from 2,500 to 65,000. <br/>            A value of 10,000 means gamma correction MUST NOT be performed. |
| illuminant_index | [EmfIlluminant](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.consts/emfilluminant/) | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the type of standard light source under which the <br/>            image is viewed, from the Illuminant enumeration (section 2.1.19). |
| red_gamma | short | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the nth power gamma correction value for the red <br/>            primary of the source colors. This value SHOULD be in the range from 2,500 to 65,000.<br/>            A value of 10,000 means gamma correction MUST NOT be performed. |
| red_green_tint | short | r/w | Gets or sets 16-bit signed integer that specifies the amount of red or green tint adjustment to be applied <br/>            to the source object. This value SHOULD be in the range from –100 to 100. <br/>            Positive numbers adjust towards red and negative numbers adjust towards green. <br/>            A value of zero means tint adjustment MUST NOT be performed |
| reference_black | short | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the black reference for the source colors. <br/>            Any colors that are darker than this are treated as black. <br/>            This value SHOULD be in the range from zero to 4,000 |
| reference_white | short | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the white reference for the source colors. <br/>            Any colors that are lighter than this are treated as white. <br/>            This value SHOULD be in the range from 6,000 to 10,000. |
| size | short | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the size in bytes of this object. This MUST be 0x0018. |
| values | [EmfColorAdjustmentEnum](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.consts/emfcoloradjustmentenum/) | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies how to prepare the output image. This field can be <br/>            set to NULL or to any combination of values in the ColorAdjustment enumeration (section 2.1.5). |
