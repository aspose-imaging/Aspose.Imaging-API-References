---

**Summary:** The HeaderExtension2 object defines the second extension to the EMF metafile header. It adds the<br/>            ability to measure device surfaces in micrometers, which enhances the resolution and scalability of EMF metafiles.

**Module:** [aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects/)

**Full Name:** aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects.EmfHeaderExtension2

**Inheritance:** EmfHeaderObject

## **Constructors**
| **Name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [EmfHeaderExtension2()](#EmfHeaderExtension2__1) | Initializes a new instance of the EmfHeaderExtension2 class |
## **Properties**
| **Name** | **Type** | **Access** | **Description** |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| bounds | [Rectangle](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/rectangle/) | r/w | Gets or sets a WMF RectL object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.19) that specifies the rectangular inclusive-inclusive <br/>            bounds in device units of the smallest rectangle that can be drawn around the image stored in <br/>            the metafile |
| bytes | int | r/w | Gets or sets  32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the size of the metafile, in bytes. |
| device | [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) | r/w | Gets or sets a WMF SizeL object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.22) that specifies the size of the reference device, in pixels |
| frame | [Rectangle](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/rectangle/) | r/w | Gets or sets a WMF RectL object that specifies the rectangular inclusive-inclusive dimensions, in .01 millimeter <br/>            units, of a rectangle that surrounds the image stored in the metafile |
| handles | int | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of graphics objects that will be used during the processing of the metafile |
| micrometers_x | int | r/w | Gets or sets the 32-bit horizontal size of the display device for which the metafile image was generated, in micrometers |
| micrometers_y | int | r/w | Gets or sets the 32-bit vertical size of the display device for which the metafile image was generated, in micrometers. |
| millimeters | [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) | r/w | Gets or sets a WMF SizeL object that specifies the size of the reference device, in millimeters |
| n_desription | int | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of characters in the array <br/>            that contains the description of the metafile's contents. This is zero if there is no description string. |
| n_pal_entries | int | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of entries in the metafile <br/>            palette. The palette is located in the EMR_EOF record |
| off_description | int | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the offset from the beginning of this <br/>            record to the array that contains the description of the metafile's contents |
| record_signature | [EmfFormatSignature](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.consts/emfformatsignature/) | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the record signature. This MUST be ENHMETA_SIGNATURE, <br/>            from the FormatSignature enumeration (section 2.1.14). |
| records | int | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of records in the metafile |
| reserved | int | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that MUST be 0x0000 and MUST be ignored |
| valid | bool | r | Gets a value indicating whether this [EmfHeaderObject](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects/emfheaderobject/) is valid. |
| version | int | r/w | Gets or sets Version (4 bytes): A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies EMF metafile interoperability. This SHOULD be 0x00010000 |
