## **Properties**
| **Name** | **Type** | **Access** | **Description** |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| argb_32_color_ref | int | r/w | Gets or sets a WMF ColorRef object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.8). The interpretation of this<br/>            field depends on the BrushStyle value, as shown in the table later in this section. |
| brush_dib_pattern | [WmfDeviceIndependentBitmap](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.wmf.objects/wmfdeviceindependentbitmap/) | r/w | Gets or sets the brush dib pattern. |
| brush_hatch | [EmfHatchStyle](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.consts/emfhatchstyle/) | r/w | Gets or sets the brush hatch pattern. The definition of this field depends on the <br/>            BrushStyle value, as shown in the table later in this section. |
| brush_style | [WmfBrushStyle](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.wmf.consts/wmfbrushstyle/) | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies a brush style for the pen from the<br/>            WMF BrushStyle enumeration ([MS-WMF] section 2.1.1.4). <br/>            If the pen type in the PenStyle field is PS_GEOMETRIC, this value MUST be either <br/>            BS_SOLID or BS_HATCHED. The value of this field can be BS_NULL, but only if the <br/>            line style specified in PenStyle is PS_NULL. The BS_NULL style SHOULD be used <br/>            to specify a brush that has no effect. |
| num_style_entities | int | r | Gets the number of elements in the array specified in the StyleEntry field. <br/>            This value SHOULD be zero if PenStyle does not specify PS_USERSTYLE. |
| pen_style | [EmfPenStyle](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.consts/emfpenstyle/) | r/w | Gets or sets the pen style |
| style_entry | int | r/w | Gets or sets an optional array of 32-bit unsigned integers that defines the lengths of <br/>            dashes and gaps in the line drawn by this pen, when the value of PenStyle <br/>            is PS_USERSTYLE line style for the pen. The array contains a number of <br/>            entries specified by NumStyleEntries, but it is used as if it repeated indefinitely <br/>            The first entry in the array specifies the length of the first dash. The second <br/>            entry specifies the length of the first gap. Thereafter, lengths of dashes and gaps alternate.<br/>            If the pen type in the PenStyle field is PS_GEOMETRIC, the lengths are specified in <br/>            logical units; otherwise, the lengths are specified in device units. |
| width | int | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the width of the line drawn by the pen.<br/>            If the pen type in the PenStyle field is PS_GEOMETRIC, this value is the width in<br/>             logical units; otherwise, the width is specified in device units. <br/>            If the pen type in the PenStyle field is PS_COSMETIC, this value MUST be 0x00000001. |
