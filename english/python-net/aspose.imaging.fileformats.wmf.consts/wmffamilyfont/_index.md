| ROMAN | Fonts with variable stroke widths, which are proportional to the actual widths of<br/>                the glyphs, and which have serifs. "MS Serif" is an example. |
| SWISS | Fonts with variable stroke widths, which are proportional to the actual widths of the<br/>                glyphs, and which do not have serifs. "MS Sans Serif" is an example. |
