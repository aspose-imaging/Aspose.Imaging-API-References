## **Members**
| **Member name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| DEFAULT | A value that specifies default behavior. |
| DEVICE | A value that specifies the choice of a device font when the system<br/>                contains multiple fonts with the same name. |
| OUTLINE | A value that specifies the requirement for TrueType and other outline fonts. |
| PS_ONLY | A value that specifies a requirement for only PostScript fonts. If there<br/>                are no PostScript fonts installed in the system, default behavior is specified. |
| RASTER | A value that specifies the choice of a rasterized font when the system<br/>                contains multiple fonts with the same name. |
| SCREEN_OUTLINE | A value that specifies a preference for TrueType and other<br/>                outline fonts. |
| STRING | A value that is returned when rasterized fonts are enumerated. |
| STROKE | A value that is returned when TrueType and other outline fonts, and<br/>                vector fonts are enumerated. |
| TT | A value that specifies the choice of a TrueType font when the system<br/>                contains multiple fonts with the same name. |
| TT_ONLY | A value that specifies the requirement for only TrueType fonts. If<br/>                there are no TrueType fonts installed in the system, default behavior is specified. |
