## **Members**
| **Member name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| FLOOD_FILL_BORDER | The fill area is bounded by the color specified by the Color member.<br/>                This style is identical to the filling performed by the<br/>                META_FLOODFILL record. |
| FLOOD_FILL_SURFACE | The fill area is bounded by the color that is specified by the Color<br/>                member. Filling continues outward in all directions as long as the<br/>                color is encountered. This style is useful for filling areas with<br/>                multicolored boundaries. |
