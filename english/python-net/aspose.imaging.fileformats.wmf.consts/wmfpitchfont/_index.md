## **Members**
| **Member name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| DEFAULT_PITCH | The default pitch, which is implementation-dependent. |
| FIXED_PITCH | A fixed pitch, which means that all the characters in the font occupy the same<br/>                width when output in a string. |
| VARIABLE_PITCH | A variable pitch, which means that the characters in the font occupy widths<br/>                that are proportional to the actual widths of the glyphs when output in a string. For example,<br/>                the "i" and space characters usually have much smaller widths than a "W" or "O" character. |
