|**Member name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|TEXT|The text<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to one device pixel. Positive x is to the right; positive y is down|
|LOMETRIC|The lometric<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to 0.1 millimeter. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.|
|HIMETRIC|The himetric<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 millimeter. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.|
|LOENGLISH|The loenglish<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.|
|HIENGLISH|The hienglish<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to 0.001 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.|
|TWIPS|The twips<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to one twentieth (1/20) of a point. In printing, a point is 1/72 of an inch; therefore,<br/>                1/20 of a point is 1/1440 of an inch. This unit is also known as a "twip".|
|ISOTROPIC|The isotropic<br/>                Logical units are mapped to arbitrary device units with equally scaled axes; that is, one unit along the x-axis is<br/>                equal to one unit along the y-axis.<br/>                The META_SETWINDOWEXT and META_SETVIEWPORTEXT records specify the units and the orientation of the axes.|
|ANISOTROPIC|The anisotropic<br/>                Logical units are mapped to arbitrary units with arbitrarily scaled axes.|
