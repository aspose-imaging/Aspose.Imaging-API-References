## **Members**
| **Member name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| ANISOTROPIC | The anisotropic<br/>                Logical units are mapped to arbitrary units with arbitrarily scaled axes. |
| HIENGLISH | The hienglish<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to 0.001 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up. |
| HIMETRIC | The himetric<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 millimeter. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up. |
| ISOTROPIC | The isotropic<br/>                Logical units are mapped to arbitrary device units with equally scaled axes; that is, one unit along the x-axis is<br/>                equal to one unit along the y-axis.<br/>                The META_SETWINDOWEXT and META_SETVIEWPORTEXT records specify the units and the orientation of the axes. |
| LOENGLISH | The loenglish<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up. |
| LOMETRIC | The lometric<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to 0.1 millimeter. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up. |
| TEXT | The text<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to one device pixel. Positive x is to the right; positive y is down |
| TWIPS | The twips<br/>                Each logical unit is mapped to one twentieth (1/20) of a point. In printing, a point is 1/72 of an inch; therefore,<br/>                1/20 of a point is 1/1440 of an inch. This unit is also known as a "twip". |
