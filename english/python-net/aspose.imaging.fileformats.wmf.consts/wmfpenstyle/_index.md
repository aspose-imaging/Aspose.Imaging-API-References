| DASHDOT | The pen has alternating dashes and dots. |
| DASHDOTDOT | The pen has dashes and double dots. |
| NULL | The pen is invisible. |
| INSIDEFRAME | The pen is solid. When this pen is used in any drawing record that takes a bounding rectangle, the dimensions of<br/>                the figure are shrunk so that it fits entirely in the bounding rectangle, taking into account the width of the pen. |
| USERSTYLE | The pen uses a styling array supplied by the user. |
| ALTERNATE | The pen sets every other pixel (this style is applicable only for cosmetic pens). |
| ENDCAP_SQUARE | Line end caps are square. |
| ENDCAP_FLAT | Line end caps are flat. |
| JOIN_BEVEL | Line joins are beveled. |
| JOIN_MITER | Line joins are mitered when they are within the current<br/>                limit set by the SETMITERLIMIT META_ESCAPE record. A join is beveled when it would exceed the limit. |
