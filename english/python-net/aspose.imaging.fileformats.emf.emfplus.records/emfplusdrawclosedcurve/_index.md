**Summary:** The EmfPlusDrawClosedCurve record specifies drawing a closed cardinal spline

**Module:** [aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.records](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.records/)

**Full Name:** aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.records.EmfPlusDrawClosedCurve

**Inheritance:** EmfPlusDrawingRecordType

## **Constructors**
| **Name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [EmfPlusDrawClosedCurve(source)](#EmfPlusDrawClosedCurve_source_1) | Initializes a new instance of the [EmfPlusDrawClosedCurve](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.records/emfplusdrawclosedcurve/) class.<br/>            RecordType - A 16-bit unsigned integer that identifies this record type as EmfPlusDrawClosedCurve<br/>            from the RecordType enumeration (section 2.1.1.1). The value MUST be 0x4017. |
## **Properties**
| **Name** | **Type** | **Access** | **Description** |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| compressed | bool | r/w | Gets or sets a value indicating whether this [EmfPlusDrawClosedCurve](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.records/emfplusdrawclosedcurve/) is compressed.<br/>            This bit indicates whether the PointData field specifies compressed data.<br/>            If set, PointData specifies absolute locations in the coordinate space with 16-bit integer coordinates. <br/>            If clear, PointData specifies absolute locations in the coordinate space with 32-bit floating-point coordinates<br/>            Note If the Relative flag (below) is set, this flag is undefined and MUST be ignored |
| data_size | int | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that MUST define the 32-bitâ€“aligned number of<br/>            bytes of data in the RecordData field that follows. This number does not include the 12-byte record header. |
| flags | short | r/w | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that contains information for some records on how<br/>            the operation is to be performed and on the structure of the record. |
| object_id | byte | r/w | Gets or sets the object identifier.<br/>            The index of an EmfPlusPen object (section 2.2.1.7) in the EMF+<br/>            Object Table to draw the closed curve. The value MUST be zero to 63, inclusive. |
| point_data | [PointF[]](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf) | r/w | Gets or sets the point data<br/>            An array of Count points that specify the endpoints of the lines that define the spline. In a closed cardinal spline, <br/>            the curve continues through the last point in the PointData array and connects with the first point in the array.<br/>            The type of data in this array is specified by the Flags field, as follows: Data Type Meaning<br/>            EmfPlusPointR object (section 2.2.2.37)<br/>            If the P flag is set in the Flags, the points specify relative locations.<br/>            EmfPlusPointF object (section 2.2.2.36)<br/>            If the P and C bits are set in the Flags field, the points specify absolute locations.<br/>            EmfPlusPoint object (section 2.2.2.35)<br/>            If the P bit is clear and the C bit is set in the Flags field, the points specify relative locations. |
| relative | bool | r/w | Gets or sets a value indicating whether this [EmfPlusDrawClosedCurve](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.records/emfplusdrawclosedcurve/) is relative.<br/>            This bit indicates whether the PointData field specifies relative or absolute locations.<br/>            If set, each element in PointData specifies a location in the coordinate space that is relative <br/>            to the location specified by the previous element in the array. In the case of the first <br/>            element in PointData, a previous location at coordinates (0,0) is assumed. If clear, <br/>            PointData specifies absolute locations according to the C flag.<br/>            Note If this flag is set, the Compressed flag (above) is undefined and MUST be ignored |
| size | int | r/w | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the 32-bit-aligned number of bytes<br/>            in the entire record, including the 12-byte record header and record-specific data. |
| tension | float | r/w | Gets or sets the tension<br/>            A 32-bit floating point number that specifies how tightly the spline <br/>            bends as it passes through the points. A value of 0 specifies that <br/>            the spline is a sequence of straight lines. As the value increases, <br/>            the curve becomes more rounded. For more information, see [SPLINE77] and [PETZOLD]. |
| type | [EmfPlusRecordType](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.consts/emfplusrecordtype/) | r | Gets a 16-bit unsigned integer that identifies the record type. |
