**Summary:** The packet version is used within block protocols. The following diagram represents a GUID as an<br/>            opaque sequence of bytes.<br/>            A GUID, also known as a UUID, is a 16-byte structure, intended to serve as a unique identifier for<br/>            an object. There are three representations of a GUID, as described in the following sections.
