| CUSTOM | Color comparison algorithm is defined by user. |
| RGB_DEFAULT | Colors are compared in the RGB color space.<br/>            Every color difference must satisfy the threshold. |
| YUV_DEFAULT | Colors are compared in the YUV color space.<br/>            Every color difference must satisfy the threshold. |
| YUV_LESS_LUMA_SENSITIVE | Colors are compared in the YUV color space.<br/>            Color information differences must satisfy the threshold, the threshold for luminance component is doubled. |
