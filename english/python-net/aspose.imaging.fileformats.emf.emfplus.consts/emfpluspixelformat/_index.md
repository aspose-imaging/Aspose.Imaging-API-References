## **Members**
| **Member name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_16BPP_ARGB1555 | The format is 16 bits per pixel; 1 bit is used for the alpha component, and 5 bits each are used for the red, green, and blue components. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_16BPP_GRAY_SCALE | The format is 16 bits per pixel, grayscale. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_16BPP_RGB555 | The format is 16 bits per pixel; 5 bits each are used for the red, green, and blue components. The remaining bit is not used. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_16BPP_RGB565 | The format is 16 bits per pixel; 5 bits are used for the red component, 6 bits for the green component, and 5 bits for the blue component. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_1BPP_INDEXED | The format is monochrome, and a color palette lookup table is used. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_24BPP_RGB | The format is 24 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the red, green, and blue components. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_32BPP_ARGB | The format is 32 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the alpha, red, green, and blue components. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_32BPP_PARGB | The format is 32 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the alpha, red, green, and blue components. The red, green, and blue components are premultiplied according to the alpha component. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_32BPP_RGB | The format is 32 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the red, green, and blue components. The remaining 8 bits are not used. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_48BPP_RGB | The format is 48 bits per pixel; 16 bits each are used for the red, green, and blue components. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_4BPP_INDEXED | The format is 16-color, and a color palette lookup table is used. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_64BPP_ARGB | The format is 64 bits per pixel; 16 bits each are used for the alpha, red, green, and blue components. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_64BPP_PARGB | The format is 64 bits per pixel; 16 bits each are used for the alpha, red, green, and blue components. The red, green, and blue components are premultiplied according to the alpha component. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_8BPP_INDEXED | The format is 256-color, and a color palette lookup table is used. |
| PIXEL_FORMAT_UNDEFINED | The format is not specified. |
