| EMF_PLUS_FILL_CLOSED_CURVE | This record defines how to fill the interior of a closed cardinal spline using a specified brush. |
| EMF_PLUS_FILL_ELLIPSE | This record defines how to fill the interiors of an ellipse, using a specified brush. |
| EMF_PLUS_FILL_PATH | The record defines how to fill the interiors of the figures defined in a graphics path with a specified brush. A path is an object that defines an arbitrary sequence of lines, curves, and shapes. |
| EMF_PLUS_FILL_PIE | This record defines how to fill a section of an interior section of an ellipse using a specified brush. |
| EMF_PLUS_FILL_POLYGON | This record defines the data to fill the interior of a polygon, using a specified brush. |

| EMF_PLUS_FILL_REGION | This record defines how to fill the interior of a region using a specified brush. |
| EMF_PLUS_GET_DC | This record specifies that subsequent EMF records encountered in the metafile SHOULD be processed. EMF records cease being processed when the next EMF+ record is encountered. |
| EMF_PLUS_HEADER | This record specifies the start of EMF+ data in the metafile. It MUST be embedded in the first EMF record after the [EmfMetafileHeader](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.records/emfmetafileheader/) record ([MS-EMF] section 2.3.4.2 record). |
| EMF_PLUS_MULTIPLY_WORLD_TRANSFORM | This record multiplies the current world space by a specified transform matrix. |
| EMF_PLUS_MULTI_FORMAT_END | This record is reserved and MUST NOT be used. |

| EMF_PLUS_MULTI_FORMAT_START | This record is reserved and MUST NOT be used. |
| EMF_PLUS_OBJECT | This record specifies an object for use in graphics operations. |
| EMF_PLUS_OFFSET_CLIP | This record applies a translation transform on the current clipping region of the world space. |
| EMF_PLUS_RESET_CLIP | This record resets the current clipping region for the world space to infinity. |
| EMF_PLUS_RESET_WORLD_TRANSFORM | This record resets the current world space transform to the identify matrix. |
| EMF_PLUS_RESTORE | This record restores the graphics state, identified by a specified index, from a stack of saved graphics states. Each stack index is associated with a particular saved state, and the index is defined by an [EmfPlusSave](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.records/emfplussave/) record (section 2.3.7.5) to save the state. |
| EMF_PLUS_ROTATE_WORLD_TRANSFORM | This record rotates the current world space by a specified angle. |
| EMF_PLUS_SAVE | This record saves the graphics state, identified by a specified index, on a stack of saved graphics states. Each stack index is associated with a particular saved state, and the index is used by an [EmfPlusRestore](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.records/emfplusrestore/) record (section 2.3.7.4) to restore the state. |
| EMF_PLUS_SCALE_WORLD_TRANSFORM | This record applies a scaling transform to the current world space by specified horizontal and vertical scale factors. |
| EMF_PLUS_SERIALIZABLE_OBJECT | This record defines an image effects parameter block that has been serialized into a data buffer. |
| EMF_PLUS_SET_ANTI_ALIAS_MODE | This record defines whether to enable or disable text anti-aliasing. Text anti-aliasing is a method of making lines and edges of character glyphs appear smoother when drawn on an output surface. |

| EMF_PLUS_SET_PAGE_TRANSFORM | This record specifies extra scaling factors for the current world space transform. |
| EMF_PLUS_SET_PIXEL_OFFSET_MODE | This record defines the pixel offset mode according to the specified pixel centering value. |
