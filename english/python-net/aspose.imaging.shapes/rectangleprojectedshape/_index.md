## **Methods**
| **Name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [get_bounds(matrix)](#get_bounds_matrix_1) | Gets the object's bounds. |
| [get_bounds(matrix, pen)](#get_bounds_matrix_pen_2) | Gets the object's bounds. |

### Method: get_bounds(matrix) {#get_bounds_matrix_1}


```
 get_bounds(matrix) 
```

Gets the object's bounds.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| matrix | [Matrix](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/matrix) | The matrix to apply before bounds will be calculated. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [RectangleF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/rectanglef) | The estimated object's bounds. |


### Method: get_bounds(matrix, pen) {#get_bounds_matrix_pen_2}


```
 get_bounds(matrix, pen) 
```

Gets the object's bounds.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| matrix | [Matrix](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/matrix) | The matrix to apply before bounds will be calculated. |
| pen | [Pen](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pen) | The pen to use for object. This can influence the object's bounds size. |

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [RectangleF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/rectanglef) | The estimated object's bounds. |


### Method: transform(transform) {#transform_transform_3}


```
 transform(transform) 
```

Applies the specified transformation to the shape.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| transform | [Matrix](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/matrix) | The transformation to apply. |
