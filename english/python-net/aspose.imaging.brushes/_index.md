The namespace provides helper classes and methods to work with different brush types.

## **Classes**
|**Class**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|[HatchBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/hatchbrush/)|Defines a rectangular brush with a hatch style, a foreground color, and a background color. This class cannot be inherited.|
|[LinearGradientBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/lineargradientbrush/)|Encapsulates a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) with a linear gradient. This class cannot be inherited.|
|[LinearGradientBrushBase](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/lineargradientbrushbase/)|Represents a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) with gradient capabilities and appropriate properties.|
|[LinearMulticolorGradientBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/linearmulticolorgradientbrush/)|Represents a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) with linear gradient defined by multiple colors and appropriate positions. This class cannot be inherited.|
|[PathGradientBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/pathgradientbrush/)|Encapsulates a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited.|
|[PathGradientBrushBase](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/pathgradientbrushbase/)|Represents a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) with base path gradient functionality.|
|[PathMulticolorGradientBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/pathmulticolorgradientbrush/)|Encapsulates a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited.|
|[SolidBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/solidbrush/)|Solid brush is intended for drawing continiously with specific color. This class cannot be inherited.|
|[TextureBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/texturebrush/)|Each property of the [TextureBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/texturebrush/) class is a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) object that uses an image to fill the interior of a shape. This class cannot be inherited.|
|[TransformBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/transformbrush/)|A [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) with transform capabilities.|
