The module provides helper classes and methods to work with different brush types.

## **Classes**
| **Class** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [HatchBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/hatchbrush/) | Defines a rectangular brush with a hatch style, a foreground color, and a background color. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [LinearGradientBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/lineargradientbrush/) | Encapsulates a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) with a linear gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [LinearGradientBrushBase](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/lineargradientbrushbase/) | Represents a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) with gradient capabilities and appropriate properties. |
| [LinearMulticolorGradientBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/linearmulticolorgradientbrush/) | Represents a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) with linear gradient defined by multiple colors and appropriate positions. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [PathGradientBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/pathgradientbrush/) | Encapsulates a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [PathGradientBrushBase](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/pathgradientbrushbase/) | Represents a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) with base path gradient functionality. |
| [PathMulticolorGradientBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/pathmulticolorgradientbrush/) | Encapsulates a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [SolidBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/solidbrush/) | Solid brush is intended for drawing continiously with specific color. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [TextureBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/texturebrush/) | Each property of the [TextureBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/texturebrush/) class is a [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) object that uses an image to fill the interior of a shape. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [TransformBrush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.brushes/transformbrush/) | A [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) with transform capabilities. |
