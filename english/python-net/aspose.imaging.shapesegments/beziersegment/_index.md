**Summary:** The bezier segment going from one point to the next point and using two control points.

**Module:** [aspose.imaging.shapesegments](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.shapesegments/)

**Full Name:** aspose.imaging.shapesegments.BezierSegment

**Inheritance:** LineSegment

## **Constructors**
| **Name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [BezierSegment(start_point, first_control_point, second_control_point, end_point)](#BezierSegment_start_point_first_control_point_second_control_point_end_point_1) | Initializes a new instance of the [BezierSegment](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.shapesegments/beziersegment/) class. |
## **Properties**
| **Name** | **Type** | **Access** | **Description** |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| end_point | [PointF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/) | r | Gets the ending point. |
| first_control_point | [PointF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/) | r | Gets the first control point of a bezier spline. |
| second_control_point | [PointF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/) | r | Gets the second control point of a bezier spline. |
| start_point | [PointF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/) | r | Gets the starting point. |
