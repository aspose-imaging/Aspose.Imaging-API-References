---

The MapMode enumeration is used to define the unit of measure for transforming page <br/>            space units into device space units and for defining the orientation of the drawing axes.

**Namespace:** [aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.consts](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.consts/)

**Full Name:** aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.consts.EmfMapMode

**Assembly:**  Aspose.Imaging Version: 23.5.6

## **Members**
|**Member name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|MM_TEXT|Each logical unit is mapped to one device pixel. Positive x is to the right; positive y is down.|
|MM_LOMETRIC|Each logical unit is mapped to 0.1 millimeter. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.|
|MM_HIMETRIC|Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 millimeter. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.|
|MM_LOENGLISH|Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up|
|MM_HIENGLISH|Each logical unit is mapped to 0.001 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.|
|MM_TWIPS|Each logical unit is mapped to one-twentieth of a printer's point <br/>            (1/1440 inch, also called a "twip"). Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.|
|MM_ISOTROPIC|Logical units are mapped to arbitrary units with equally scaled axes; that is, one unit <br/>            along the x-axis is equal to one unit along the y-axis. The EMR_SETWINDOWEXTEX and <br/>            EMR_SETVIEWPORTEXTEX records SHOULD be used to specify the units and the orientation <br/>            of the axes.<br/>            Adjustments MUST be made as necessary to ensure that the x and y units remain the same size. <br/>            For example, when the window extent is set, the viewport MUST be adjusted to keep the units isotropic.|
|MM_ANISOTROPIC|Logical units are mapped to arbitrary units with arbitrarily scaled axes. <br/>            The EMR_SETWINDOWEXTEX and EMR_SETVIEWPORTEXTEX records SHOULD be used to specify the units, <br/>            orientation, and scaling.|
