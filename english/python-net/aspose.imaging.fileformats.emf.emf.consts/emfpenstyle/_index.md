The PenStyle enumeration defines the attributes of pens that can be used in graphics operations.<br/>             A pen style is a combination of pen type, line style, line cap, and line join.

## **Members**
| **Member name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| END_CAP_MASK | The end cap mask |
| JOIN_MASK | The join mask |
| PS_ALTERNATE | A line style in which every other pixel is set. This style is applicable only to a pen type of PS_COSMETIC |
| PS_COSMETIC | A pen type that specifies a line with a width of one logical unit and a style that is a solid color |
| PS_DASH | A line style that is dashed |
| PS_DASHDOT | A line style that consists of alternating dashes and dots |
| PS_DASHDOTDOT | A line style that consists of dashes and double dots. |
| PS_DOT | A line style that is dotted. |
| PS_ENDCAP_FLAT | A line cap that specifies flat ends. |
| PS_ENDCAP_ROUND | A line cap that specifies round ends. |
| PS_ENDCAP_SQUARE | A line cap that specifies square ends. |
| PS_GEOMETRIC | A pen type that specifies a line with a width that is measured in logical units <br/>            and a style that can contain any of the attributes of a brush. |
| PS_INSIDEFRAME | A line style that is a solid color. When this style is specified in a drawing record <br/>            that takes a bounding rectangle, the dimensions of the figure are shrunk so that <br/>            it fits entirely in the bounding rectangle, taking into account the width of the pen. |
| PS_JOIN_BEVEL | A line join that specifies beveled joins. |
| PS_JOIN_MITER | A line join that specifies mitered joins when the lengths of the joins are within the current miter <br/>            length limit that is set in the playback device context. <br/>            If the lengths of the joins exceed the miter limit, beveled joins are specified |
| PS_JOIN_ROUND | A line join that specifies round joins |
| PS_NULL | A line style that is invisible. |
| PS_SOLID | A line style that is a solid color |
| PS_USERSTYLE | A line style that is defined by a styling array, which specifies the lengths of dashes and gaps in the line |
| STYLE_MASK | The style mask |
| TYPE_MASK | The type mask |
