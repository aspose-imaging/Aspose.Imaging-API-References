| :- | :- |
| BEZIERTO | Specifies that this point is a control point or ending point for a Bezier curve. |
| CLOSEFIGURE | A PT_LINETO or PT_BEZIERTO type can be combined with this value by using the bitwise <br/>            operator OR to indicate that the corresponding point is the last point in a figure <br/>            and the figure is closed |
| LINETO | Specifies that a line is to be drawn from the current position to this point, <br/>            which then becomes the new current position |
| MOVETO | Specifies that this point starts a disjoint figure. This point becomes the new current position. |
