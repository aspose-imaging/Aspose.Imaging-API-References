**Full Name:** aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.consts.EmfColorSpace

## **Members**
| **Member name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| CS_DELETE_TRANSFORM | If color management is enabled for the target profile, disables it and deletes the concatenated transform. |
| CS_DISABLE | Disables color proofing. |
| CS_ENABLE | Maps colors to the target device's color gamut. This enables color proofing. <br/>            All subsequent draw commands to the playback device context will render colors as they would appear on the target device. |
