Represents an ordered pair of floating-point x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane.

**Namespace:** [aspose.imaging](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/)

**Full Class Name:** aspose.imaging.PointF

**Assembly:**  Aspose.Imaging Version: 23.5.0

The PointF type exposes the following members:
## **Constructors**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|PointF(x, y)|Initializes a new instance of the PointF class|

## **Properties**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|empty|Gets a new instance of the [PointF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/) structure that has [x](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/) and [y](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/) values set to zero.|
|is_empty|Gets a value indicating whether this [PointF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/) is empty.|
|x|Gets or sets the x-coordinate of this [PointF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/).|
|y|Gets or sets the y-coordinate of this [PointF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/).|
