The [InterpolationMode](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/interpolationmode/) enumeration specifies the algorithm that is used when images are scaled or rotated.

**Namespace:** [aspose.imaging](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/)

**Full Name:** aspose.imaging.InterpolationMode

**Assembly:**  Aspose.Imaging Version: 23.5.0

## **Members**
|**Member name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|INVALID|Invalid interpolation mode.|
|DEFAULT|Specifies default mode.|
|LOW|Specifies low quality interpolation.|
|HIGH|Specifies high quality interpolation.|
|BILINEAR|Specifies bilinear interpolation. No prefiltering is done. This mode is not suitable for shrinking an image below 50 percent of its original size.|
|BICUBIC|Specifies bicubic interpolation. No prefiltering is done. This mode is not suitable for shrinking an image below 25 percent of its original size.|
|NEAREST_NEIGHBOR|Specifies nearest-neighbor interpolation.|
|HIGH_QUALITY_BILINEAR|Specifies high-quality, bilinear interpolation. Prefiltering is performed to ensure high-quality shrinking.|
|HIGH_QUALITY_BICUBIC|Specifies high-quality, bicubic interpolation. Prefiltering is performed to ensure high-quality shrinking. This mode produces the highest quality transformed images.|
