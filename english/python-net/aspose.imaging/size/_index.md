Represents size.

**Namespace:** [aspose.imaging](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/)

**Full Class Name:** aspose.imaging.Size

**Assembly:**  Aspose.Imaging Version: 23.6.0

The Size type exposes the following members:
## **Constructors**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|Size(point)|Initializes a new instance of the Size class|
|Size(width, height)|Initializes a new instance of the Size class|
|Size()|Initializes a new instance of the Size class|
## **Properties**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|empty|Gets a new instance of the [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) structure that has [width](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) and [height](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) values set to zero.|
|is_empty|Gets a value indicating whether this [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) has width and height of 0.|
|width|Gets or sets the horizontal component of this [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/).|
|height|Gets or sets the vertical component of this [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/).|
## **Methods**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|add(size1, size2)|Adds the width and height of one [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) structure to the width and height of another [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) structure.|
|ceiling(size)|Converts the specified [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure to a [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) structure by rounding the values of the [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) structure to the next higher integer values.|
|subtract(size1, size2)|Subtracts the width and height of one [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) structure from the width and height of another [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) structure.|
|truncate(size)|Converts the specified [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure to a [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) structure by truncating the values of the [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure to the next lower integer values.|
|round(size)|Converts the specified [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure to a [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) structure by rounding the values of the [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure to the nearest integer values.|
