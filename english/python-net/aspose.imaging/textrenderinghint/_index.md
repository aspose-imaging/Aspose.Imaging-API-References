## **Members**
|**Member name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|SYSTEM_DEFAULT|Each character is drawn using its glyph bitmap, with the system default rendering hint. The text will be drawn using whatever font-smoothing settings the user has selected for the system.|
|SINGLE_BIT_PER_PIXEL_GRID_FIT|Each character is drawn using its glyph bitmap. Hinting is used to improve character appearance on stems and curvature.|
|SINGLE_BIT_PER_PIXEL|Each character is drawn using its glyph bitmap. Hinting is not used.|
|ANTI_ALIAS_GRID_FIT|Each character is drawn using its antialiased glyph bitmap with hinting. Much better quality due to antialiasing, but at a higher performance cost.|
|ANTI_ALIAS|Each character is drawn using its antialiased glyph bitmap without hinting. Better quality due to antialiasing. Stem width differences may be noticeable because hinting is turned off.|
|CLEAR_TYPE_GRID_FIT|Each character is drawn using its glyph ClearType bitmap with hinting. The highest quality setting. Used to take advantage of ClearType font features.|
