**Summary:** The base brush class.

**Module:** [aspose.imaging](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/)

**Full Name:** aspose.imaging.Brush

**Inheritance:** DisposableObject

**Aspose.Imaging Version:** 23.12.0

## **Properties**
| **Name** | **Type** | **Access** | **Description** |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| disposed | bool | r | Gets a value indicating whether this instance is disposed. |
| [opacity](#opacity1) | float | r/w | Gets or sets the brush opacity. The value should be between 0 and 1. Value of 0 means that brush is fully visible, value of 1 means the brush is fully opaque. |
## **Methods**
| **Name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| [deep_clone()](#deep_clone__1) | Creates a new deep clone of the current [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/). |


### Property: opacity {#opacity1}

Gets or sets the brush opacity. The value should be between 0 and 1. Value of 0 means that brush is fully visible, value of 1 means the brush is fully opaque.

### Method: deep_clone() {#deep_clone__1}


```
 deep_clone() 
```

Creates a new deep clone of the current [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/).

**Returns**

| Type | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush) | A new [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) which is the deep clone of this [Brush](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/brush/) instance. |


## **Examples**
### This example uses Graphics class to create primitive shapes on the Image surface. To demonstrate the operation, the example creates a new Image in PNG format and draw primitive shapes on Image surface using Draw methods exposed by Graphics class {#example_12}
