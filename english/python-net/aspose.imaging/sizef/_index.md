Stores an ordered pair of floating-point numbers, typically the width and height of a rectangle.

**Namespace:** [aspose.imaging](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/)

**Full Class Name:** aspose.imaging.SizeF

**Assembly:**  Aspose.Imaging Version: 23.5.0

The SizeF type exposes the following members:
## **Constructors**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|SizeF(size)|Initializes a new instance of the SizeF class|
|SizeF(point)|Initializes a new instance of the SizeF class|
|SizeF(width, height)|Initializes a new instance of the SizeF class|
|SizeF()|Initializes a new instance of the SizeF class|
## **Properties**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|empty|Gets a new instance of the [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure that has [width](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) and [height](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) values set to zero.|
|is_empty|Gets a value indicating whether this [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) has zero width and height.|
|width|Gets or sets the horizontal component of this [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/).|
|height|Gets or sets the vertical component of this [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/).|
## **Methods**
|**Name**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|create_from_size_f(size)|Initializes a new instance of the [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure from the specified [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/).|
|create_from_point_f(point)|Initializes a new instance of the [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure from the specified [PointF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/).|
|add(size1, size2)|Adds the width and height of one [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure to the width and height of another [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure.|
|subtract(size1, size2)|Subtracts the width and height of one [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure from the width and height of another [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) structure.|
|to_point_f()|Converts a [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) to a [PointF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pointf/).|
|to_size()|Converts a [SizeF](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/sizef/) to a [Size](/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/size/) structure with truncated size values.|
