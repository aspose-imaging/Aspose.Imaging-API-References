## WmfBitmapInfoHeader.Height property

Gets or sets 32-bit signed integer that defines the height of the DIB, in pixels. This value MUST NOT be zero. If this value is positive, the DIB is a bottom-up bitmap, and its origin is the lower-left corner. If this value is negative, the DIB is a top-down bitmap, and its origin is the upper-left corner. Top-down bitmaps do not support compression. This field SHOULD specify the height of the decompressed image file, if the Compression value specifies JPEG or PNG format.

```csharp
public int Height { get; set; }
```
