Rotate the image around its center with the Rotate method of the RasterCachedMultipageImage class. This convenient feature allows you to easily adjust the orientation of images while maintaining their center position, enhancing your image manipulation capabilities.

```csharp
public override void Rotate(float angle, bool resizeProportionally, Color backgroundColor)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| angle | Single | The rotate angle in degrees. Positive values will rotate clockwise. |
| resizeProportionally | Boolean | if set to `true` you will have your image size changed according to rotated rectangle (corner points) projections in other case that leaves dimensions untouched and only `internal` image contents are rotated. |
| backgroundColor | Color | Color of the background. |
