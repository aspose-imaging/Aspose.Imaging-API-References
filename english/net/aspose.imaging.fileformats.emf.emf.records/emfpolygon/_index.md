## EmfPolygon class

The EMR_POLYGON record specifies a polygon consisting of two or more vertexes connected by straight lines.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfPolygon : EmfDrawingRecordType
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |

| [EmfPolygon](emfpolygon)(EmfRecord) | Initializes a new instance of the [`EmfPolygon`](../emfpolygon) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [APoints](apoints) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a Count length array of WMF PointL objects ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.15) that specifies the vertexes of the polygon in logical units. |
| [Bounds](bounds) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 128-bit WMF RectL object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.19) that specifies the bounding rectangle in device units. |
