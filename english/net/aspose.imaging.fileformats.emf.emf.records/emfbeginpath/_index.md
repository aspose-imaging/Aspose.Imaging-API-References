## EmfBeginPath class

This record opens a path bracket in the current playback device context. After a path bracket is open, an application can begin processing records to define the points that lie in the path.An application MUST close an open path bracket by processing the EMR_ENDPATH record. When an application processes the EMR_BEGINPATH record, all previous paths MUST be discarded from the playback device context.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfBeginPath : EmfPathBracketRecordType
```
