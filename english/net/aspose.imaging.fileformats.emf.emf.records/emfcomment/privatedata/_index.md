## EmfComment.PrivateData property

Gets or sets an optional array of bytes that specifies the private data. The first DWORD of this data MUST NOT be one of the predefined comment identifier values specified in section 2.3.3. Private data is unknown to EMF; it is meaningful only to applications that know the format of the data and how to use it. EMR_COMMENT private data records MAY be ignored.

```csharp
public byte[] PrivateData { get; set; }
```
