## EmfPolygon16 class

The EMR_POLYGON16 record specifies a polygon consisting of two or more vertexes connected by straight lines. The polygon is outlined by using the current pen and filled by using the current brush and polygon fill mode. The polygon is closed automatically by drawing a line from the last vertex to the first.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfPolygon16 : EmfPolyShape
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EmfPolygon16](emfpolygon16/#constructor)() | Initializes a new instance of the `EmfPolygon16` class. |
| [EmfPolygon16](emfpolygon16/#constructor_1)(EmfRecord) | Initializes a new instance of the `EmfPolygon16` class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [APoints](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.records/emfpolyshape/apoints/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets an array of WMF PointL objects ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.15) that specifies the point data, in logical units. |
| [Bounds](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.records/emfboundedrecord/bounds/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets an 128-bit WMF RectL object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.19) that specifies the bounding rectangle, in device units. |
| [Size](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.records/emfrecord/size/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the size of the record |
| [Type](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.records/emfrecord/type/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the type. |

## Remarks

The polygon SHOULD be outlined using the current pen and filled using the current brush and polygon fill mode. The polygon SHOULD be closed automatically by drawing a line from the last vertex to the first
