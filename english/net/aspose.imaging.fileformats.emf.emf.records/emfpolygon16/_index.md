## EmfPolygon16 class

The EMR_POLYGON16 record specifies a polygon consisting of two or more vertexes connected by straight lines. The polygon is outlined by using the current pen and filled by using the current brush and polygon fill mode. The polygon is closed automatically by drawing a line from the last vertex to the first.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfPolygon16 : EmfDrawingRecordType
```
