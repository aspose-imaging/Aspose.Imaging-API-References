## EmfBlendFunction.SrcConstantAlpha property

Gets an 8-bit unsigned integer that specifies alpha transparency, which determines the blend of the source and destination bitmaps. This value MUST be used on the entire source bitmap. The minimum alpha transparency value, zero, corresponds to completely transparent the maximum value, 0xFF, corresponds to completely opaque. In effect, a value of 0xFF specifies that the per-pixel alpha values determine the blend of the source and destination bitmaps. See the equations later in this section for details.

```csharp
public byte SrcConstantAlpha { get; }
```
