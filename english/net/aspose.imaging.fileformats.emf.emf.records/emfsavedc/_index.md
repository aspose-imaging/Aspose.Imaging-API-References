## EmfSaveDc class

Saves the current state of playback device context on a stack of states saved by preceding EMR_SAVEDC records, if any. The state consists of graphics properties and objects, including the currently selected bitmap, brush, palette, font, pen, and region. An EMR_RESTOREDC record is used to restore the state. This EMF record specifies no parameters.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfSaveDc : EmfStateRecordType
```
