## EmfSetColorAdjustment class

The EMR_SETCOLORADJUSTMENT record specifies color adjustment properties in the playback device context.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfSetColorAdjustment : EmfStateRecordType
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EmfSetColorAdjustment](emfsetcoloradjustment)(EmfRecord) | Initializes a new instance of the [`EmfSetColorAdjustment`](../emfsetcoloradjustment) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ColorAdjustment](coloradjustment) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a ColorAdjustment object (section 2.2.2) that specifies color adjustment values. |

### Remarks

Color adjustment values are used to adjust the input color of the source bitmap for graphics operations performed by EMR_STRETCHBLT and EMR_STRETCHDIBITS records when STRETCH_HALFTONE mode is set from the StretchMode enumeration (section 2.1.32). The ColorAdjustment object specified by this record MUST be used in graphics operations that require a ColorAdjustment object, until a different ColorAdjustment object is specified by another EMR_SETCOLORADJUSTMENT record, or until the object is removed by a EMR_DELETEOBJECT record.
