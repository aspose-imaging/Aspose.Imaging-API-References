## EmfPolyPolygon16 class

The EMR_POLYPOLYGON16 record specifies a series of closed polygons. Each polygon is outlined using the current pen, and filled using the current brush and polygon fill mode. The polygons drawn by this record can overlap.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfPolyPolygon16 : EmfPolyPolyShape
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EmfPolyPolygon16](emfpolypolygon16/#constructor)() | Initializes a new instance of the `EmfPolyPolygon16` class. |
| [EmfPolyPolygon16](emfpolypolygon16/#constructor_1)(EmfRecord) | Initializes a new instance of the `EmfPolyPolygon16` class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [APoints](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.records/emfpolypolyshape/apoints/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets an array of WMF PointS objects, specified in [MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.16, which specifies the array of points. |
| [Bounds](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.records/emfboundedrecord/bounds/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets an 128-bit WMF RectL object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.19) that specifies the bounding rectangle, in device units. |
| [Size](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.records/emfrecord/size/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the size of the record |
| [Type](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.records/emfrecord/type/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the type. |

## Remarks

Each polygon SHOULD be outlined using the current pen, and filled using the current brush and polygon fill mode that are defined in the playback device context. The polygons defined by this record can overlap.
