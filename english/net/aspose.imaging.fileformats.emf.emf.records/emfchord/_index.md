## EmfChord class

The EMR_CHORD record specifies a chord, which is a region bounded by the intersection of an ellipse and a line segment, called a secant. The chord is outlined by using the current pen and filled by using the current brush.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfChord : EmfDrawingRecordType
```
