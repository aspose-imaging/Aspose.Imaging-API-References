| PhotometricInterpretation | `262` | The pixel composition. |
| ImageDescription | `270` | A character string giving the title of the image. It may be a comment such as "1988 company picnic" or the like. |

| Model | `272` | The model name or model number of the equipment. This is the model name or number of the DSC, scanner, video digitizer or other equipment that generated the image. When the field is left blank, it is treated as unknown. |
| Orientation | `274` | The image orientation viewed in terms of rows and columns. |
| SamplesPerPixel | `277` | The number of components per pixel. Since this standard applies to RGB and YCbCr images, the value set for this tag is 3. |
