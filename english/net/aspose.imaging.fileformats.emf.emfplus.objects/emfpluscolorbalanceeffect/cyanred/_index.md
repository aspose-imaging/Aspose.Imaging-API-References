## EmfPlusColorBalanceEffect.CyanRed property

Gets or sets a 32-bit signed integer that specifies a change in the amount of red in the image. This value MUST be in the range -100 through 100, with effects as follows: -100 ≤ value &lt; 0 As the value decreases, the amount of red in the image SHOULD decrease and the amount of cyan SHOULD increase. 0 A value of 0 specifies that the amounts of red and cyan MUST NOT change. 0 &lt; value ≤ 100 As the value increases, the amount of red in the image SHOULD increase and the amount of cyan SHOULD decrease.

```csharp
public int CyanRed { get; set; }
```
