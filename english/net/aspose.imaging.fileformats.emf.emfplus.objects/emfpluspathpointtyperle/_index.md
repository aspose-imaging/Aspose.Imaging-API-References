## EmfPlusPathPointTypeRle class

The EmfPlusPathPointTypeRle object specifies type values associated with points on a graphics path using RLE compression. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3 0 1 B&#x7C;1&#x7C;RunCount &#x7C; PointType &#x7C; B (1 bit): If set, the path points are on a Bezier curve. If clear, the path points are on a graphics line. RunCount (6 bits): The run count, which is the number of path points to be associated with the type in the PointType field. PointType (1 byte): An EmfPlusPathPointType object (section 2.2.2.31) that specifies the type to associate with the path points.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfPlusPathPointTypeRle : EmfPlusBasePointType
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Bezier](bezier) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value indicating whether this [`EmfPlusPathPointTypeRle`](../emfpluspathpointtyperle) is bezier. If set, the path points are on a Bezier curve. If clear, the path points are on a graphics line. |
| [Data](data) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the data. |
| [PointType](pointtype) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the type of the point. PointType (1 byte): An EmfPlusPathPointType object (section 2.2.2.31) that specifies the type to associate with the path points. |
| [RunCount](runcount) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the run count. RunCount (6 bits): The run count, which is the number of path points to be associated with the type in the PointType field |
