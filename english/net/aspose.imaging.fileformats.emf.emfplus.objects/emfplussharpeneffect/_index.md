## EmfPlusSharpenEffect class

The SharpenEffect object specifies an increase in the difference in intensity between pixels in an image.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfPlusSharpenEffect : EmfPlusImageEffectsObjectType
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EmfPlusSharpenEffect](emfplussharpeneffect)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Amount](amount) { get; set; } | Gets or sets A 32-bit floating-point number that specifies the difference in intensity between a given pixel and the surrounding pixels. 0 Specifies that sharpening MUST NOT be performed. 0 &lt; value ≤ 100 As this value increases, the difference in intensity between pixels SHOULD increase. |
| [Radius](radius) { get; set; } | Gets or sets A 32-bit floating-point number that specifies the sharpening radius in pixels, which determines the number of pixels involved in calculating the new value of a given pixel. As this value increases, the number of pixels involved in the calculation increases, and the resulting bitmap SHOULD become sharper. |
