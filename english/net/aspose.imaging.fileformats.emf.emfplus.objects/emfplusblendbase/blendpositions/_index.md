## EmfPlusBlendBase.BlendPositions property

Gets or sets blend positions An array of PositionCount 32-bit floating-point values that specify proportions of distance along the gradient line. Each element MUST be a number between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive. For a linear gradient brush, 0.0 represents the starting point and 1.0 represents the ending point. For a path gradient brush, 0.0 represents the midpoint and 1.0 represents an endpoint

```csharp
public float[] BlendPositions { get; set; }
```
