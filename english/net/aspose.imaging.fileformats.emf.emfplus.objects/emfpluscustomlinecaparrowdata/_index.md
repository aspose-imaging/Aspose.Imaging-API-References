## EmfPlusCustomLineCapArrowData class

The EmfPlusCustomLineCapArrowData object specifies adjustable arrow data for a custom line cap.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfPlusCustomLineCapArrowData : EmfPlusCustomBaseLineCap
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EmfPlusCustomLineCapArrowData](emfpluscustomlinecaparrowdata)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FillHotSpot](fillhotspot) { get; set; } | Gets or sets EmfPlusPointF object that is not currently used. It MUST be set to {0.0, 0.0}. |
| [FillState](fillstate) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit Boolean value that specifies whether the arrow cap is filled. If the arrow cap is not filled, only the outline is drawn |
| [Height](height) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit floating-point value that specifies the height of the arrow cap. |
| [LineEndCap](lineendcap) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the value in the LineCap enumeration that indicates the line cap to be used at the end of the line to be drawn |
| [LineHotSpot](linehotspot) { get; set; } | Gets or sets an EmfPlusPointF object that is not currently used. It MUST be set to {0.0, 0.0}. |
| [LineJoin](linejoin) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the value in the LineJoin enumeration that specifies how to join two lines that are drawn by the same pen and whose ends meet. At the intersection of the two line ends, a line join makes the connection look more continuous. |
| [LineMiterLimit](linemiterlimit) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit floating-point value that specifies the limit of the thickness of the join on a mitered corner by setting the maximum allowed ratio of miter length to line width |
| [LineStartCap](linestartcap) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the value in the LineCap enumeration that indicates the line cap to be used at the start of the line to be drawn |
| [MiddleInset](middleinset) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit floating-point value that specifies the number of pixels between the outline of the arrow cap and the fill of the arrow cap. |
| [Width](width) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit floating-point value that specifies the width of the arrow cap |
| [WidthScale](widthscale) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit floating-point value that specifies the amount by which to scale an EmfPlusCustomLineCap object with respect to the width of the graphics pen that is used to draw the lines |
