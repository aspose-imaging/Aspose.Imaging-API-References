## JpegImage.DestinationRgbColorProfile property

The RGBColorProfile is essential for the accurate color conversion of CMYK and YCCK JPEG images during the saving process. When paired with the CMYKColorProfile, it ensures that the colors are rendered correctly and maintains consistency across different devices and applications. This combination is crucial for preserving the intended color representation and achieving high-quality image output.

```csharp
public StreamSource DestinationRgbColorProfile { get; set; }
```
