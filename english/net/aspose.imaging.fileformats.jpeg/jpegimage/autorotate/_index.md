## JpegImage.AutoRotate method

Automatically rotates the image based on orientation data extracted from Exif metadata. This method ensures that images are displayed in the correct orientation, enhancing user experience and eliminating the need for manual adjustments. By analyzing Exif information, the image is rotated accordingly, providing a seamless viewing experience across different platforms and devices. This automated rotation process simplifies image handling and improves overall usability, especially when dealing with large batches of images with varying orientations.

```csharp
public void AutoRotate()
```
