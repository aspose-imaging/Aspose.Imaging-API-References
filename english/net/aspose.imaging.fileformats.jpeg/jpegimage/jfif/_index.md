## JpegImage.Jfif property

This property allows you to access or modify the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) data associated with the JPEG image. JFIF is a standard format for exchanging JPEG-compressed images between computers and other devices. By getting or setting this property, you can interact with the JFIF data, which may include information such as the image's resolution, aspect ratio, and thumbnail.

```csharp
public JFIFData Jfif { get; set; }
```
