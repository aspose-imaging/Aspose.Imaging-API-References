The namespace handles Jpeg file format processing.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [JFIFData](./jfifdata/) | The jfif segment. |
| [JpegImage](./jpegimage/) | Efficiently manipulate JPEG raster images with our API, offering support for various color profiles such as RGB and CMYK, customizable bits per pixel resolution, and processing of EXIF, JFIF, and XMP metadata containers. Enjoy automated rotation based on orientation data and choose from different compression levels, including lossless JPEG, to achieve optimal image quality and file size balance for your projects. |
| [JpegLsPresetCodingParameters](./jpeglspresetcodingparameters/) | Defines the JPEG-LS preset coding parameters as defined in ISO/IEC 14495-1, C.2.4.1.1. JPEG-LS defines a default set of parameters, but custom parameters can be used. When used these parameters are written into the encoded bit stream as they are needed for the decoding process. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [JfifDensityUnits](./jfifdensityunits/) | The jfif density units. |
| [JpegCompressionColorMode](./jpegcompressioncolormode/) | Сolor mode for jpeg images. |
| [JpegCompressionMode](./jpegcompressionmode/) | Compression mode for jpeg images. |
| [JpegLsInterleaveMode](./jpeglsinterleavemode/) | Defines the interleave mode for multi-component (color) pixel data. |
| [SampleRoundingMode](./sampleroundingmode/) | Defines a way in which an n-bit value is converted to an 8-bit value. |
