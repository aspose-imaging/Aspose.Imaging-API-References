## StreamSource class

Represents a stream source.

```csharp
public sealed class StreamSource : Source
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [StreamSource](streamsource)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`StreamSource`](../streamsource) class. |
| [StreamSource](streamsource)(Stream) | Initializes a new instance of the [`StreamSource`](../streamsource) class. |
| [StreamSource](streamsource)(Stream, bool) | Initializes a new instance of the [`StreamSource`](../streamsource) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DisposeStream](../../aspose.imaging.sources/streamsource/disposestream) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether stream should be disposed whenever container gets disposed. |
| [Stream](../../aspose.imaging.sources/streamsource/stream) { get; } | Gets the stream. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| override [GetStreamContainer](../../aspose.imaging.sources/streamsource/getstreamcontainer)() | Gets the stream container. |

### Examples

This example demonstrates the use of System.IO.Stream to Create a new Image file (a JPEG type)

```csharp
[C#]

//Creates an instance of JpegOptions and set its various properties
Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.JpegOptions jpegOptions = new Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.JpegOptions();

//Create an instance of System.IO.Stream
System.IO.Stream stream = new System.IO.FileStream(@"C:\temp\sample.jpeg", System.IO.FileMode.Create);

//Define the source property for the instance of JpegOptions
//Second boolean parameter determins if the Stream is disposed once get out of scope
jpegOptions.Source = new Aspose.Imaging.Sources.StreamSource(stream, true);

//Creates an instance of Image and call Create method with JpegOptions as parameter to initialize the Image object   
using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Create(jpegOptions, 500, 500))
{
    //do some image processing
}
```

This example uses Graphics class to create primitive shapes on the Image surface. To demonstrate the operation, the example creates a new Image in PNG format and draw primitive shapes on Image surface using Draw methods exposed by Graphics class

```csharp
[C#]

//Creates an instance of FileStream
using (System.IO.FileStream stream = new System.IO.FileStream(@"C:\temp\output.png", System.IO.FileMode.Create))
{
    //Create an instance of PngOptions and set its various properties
    Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.PngOptions pngOptions = new Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.PngOptions();

    //Set the Source for PngOptions
    pngOptions.Source = new Aspose.Imaging.Sources.StreamSource(stream);

    //Create an instance of Image 
    using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Create(pngOptions, 500, 500))
    {
        //Create and initialize an instance of Graphics class
        Aspose.Imaging.Graphics graphics = new Aspose.Imaging.Graphics(image);

        //Clear Graphics surface
        graphics.Clear(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Wheat);

        //Draw an Arc by specifying the Pen object having Black color, 
        //a Rectangle surrounding the Arc, Start Angle and Sweep Angle
        graphics.DrawArc(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Black, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(200, 200, 100, 200), 0, 300);

        //Draw a Bezier by specifying the Pen object having Blue color and co-ordinate Points.
        graphics.DrawBezier(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Blue, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(250, 100), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(300, 30), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(450, 100), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(235, 25));

        //Draw a Curve by specifying the Pen object having Green color and an array of Points
        graphics.DrawCurve(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Green, 2), new[] { new Aspose.Imaging.Point(100, 200), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(100, 350), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(200, 450) });

        //Draw an Ellipse using the Pen object and a surrounding Rectangle
        graphics.DrawEllipse(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Yellow, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(300, 300, 100, 100));

        //Draw a Line 
        graphics.DrawLine(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Violet, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(100, 100), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(200, 200));

        //Draw a Pie segment
        graphics.DrawPie(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Silver, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Point(200, 20), new Aspose.Imaging.Size(200, 200)), 0, 45);

        //Draw a Polygon by specifying the Pen object having Red color and an array of Points
        graphics.DrawPolygon(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Red, 2), new[] { new Aspose.Imaging.Point(20, 100), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(20, 200), new Aspose.Imaging.Point(220, 20) });

        //Draw a Rectangle
        graphics.DrawRectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Orange, 2), new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Point(250, 250), new Aspose.Imaging.Size(100, 100)));

        //Create a SolidBrush object and set its various properties
        Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.SolidBrush brush = new Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.SolidBrush();
        brush.Color = Color.Purple;
        brush.Opacity = 100;

        //Draw a String using the SolidBrush object and Font, at specific Point
        graphics.DrawString("This image is created by Aspose.Imaging API", new Aspose.Imaging.Font("Times New Roman", 16), brush, new Aspose.Imaging.PointF(50, 400));

        // save all changes.
        image.Save();
    }
}
```
