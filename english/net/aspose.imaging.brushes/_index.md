The namespace provides helper classes and methods to work with different brush types.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| class [HatchBrush](./hatchbrush) | Defines a rectangular brush with a hatch style, a foreground color, and a background color. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [LinearGradientBrush](./lineargradientbrush) | Encapsulates a [`Brush`](aspose.imaging/brush) with a linear gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| abstract class [LinearGradientBrushBase](./lineargradientbrushbase) | Represents a [`Brush`](aspose.imaging/brush) with gradient capabilities and appropriate properties. |
| class [LinearMulticolorGradientBrush](./linearmulticolorgradientbrush) | Represents a [`Brush`](aspose.imaging/brush) with linear gradient defined by multiple colors and appropriate positions. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [PathGradientBrush](./pathgradientbrush) | Encapsulates a [`Brush`](aspose.imaging/brush) object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| abstract class [PathGradientBrushBase](./pathgradientbrushbase) | Represents a [`Brush`](aspose.imaging/brush) with base path gradient functionality. |
| class [PathMulticolorGradientBrush](./pathmulticolorgradientbrush) | Encapsulates a [`Brush`](aspose.imaging/brush) object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [SolidBrush](./solidbrush) | Solid brush is intended for drawing continiously with specific color. This class cannot be inherited. |
| class [TextureBrush](./texturebrush) | Each property of the [`TextureBrush`](aspose.imaging.brushes/texturebrush) class is a [`Brush`](aspose.imaging/brush) object that uses an image to fill the interior of a shape. This class cannot be inherited. |
| abstract class [TransformBrush](./transformbrush) | A [`Brush`](aspose.imaging/brush) with transform capabilities. |
