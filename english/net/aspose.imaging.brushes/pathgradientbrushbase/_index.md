## PathGradientBrushBase class

Represents a [`Brush`](../../aspose.imaging/brush) with base path gradient functionality.

```csharp
public abstract class PathGradientBrushBase : TransformBrush
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CenterPoint](centerpoint) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the center point of the path gradient. |
| [FocusScales](focusscales) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the focus point for the gradient falloff. |
| [GraphicsPath](graphicspath) { get; } | Gets the graphics path this brush was build upon. |
| [PathPoints](pathpoints) { get; } | Gets the path points this brush was build upon. |

### Remarks

Note that when creating the [`PathGradientBrushBase`](../pathgradientbrushbase) class it should be initialized with 2 points at least. The internal path created will always be a closed figure, the last point connects the first point. That shape is filled with this [`PathGradientBrushBase`](../pathgradientbrushbase). The GDI+ implementation throws an OutOfMemoryException when passing in empty arrays or points set having the same coordinates. The [`PathGradientBrushBase`](../pathgradientbrushbase) throws an exception when points array contain less than 2 points, the ArgumentException is thrown rather than OutOfMemoryException when points array is unacceptable. The center point is calculated as a center of mass for the passed in points by default. A user can change this point later. The focus scales is an empty point (0.0, 0.0) by default.
