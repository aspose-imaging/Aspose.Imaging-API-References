## PathGradientBrush.SetSigmaBellShape method (1 of 2)

Creates a gradient brush that changes color starting from the center of the path outward to the path's boundary. The transition from one color to another is based on a bell-shaped curve.

```csharp
public void SetSigmaBellShape(float focus)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| focus | Single | A value from 0 through 1 that specifies where, along any radial from the center of the path to the path's boundary, the center color will be at its highest intensity. A value of 1 (the default) places the highest intensity at the center of the path. |

## PathGradientBrush.SetSigmaBellShape method (2 of 2)

Creates a gradient brush that changes color starting from the center of the path outward to the path's boundary. The transition from one color to another is based on a bell-shaped curve.

```csharp
public void SetSigmaBellShape(float focus, float scale)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| focus | Single | A value from 0 through 1 that specifies where, along any radial from the center of the path to the path's boundary, the center color will be at its highest intensity. A value of 1 (the default) places the highest intensity at the center of the path. |
| scale | Single | A value from 0 through 1 that specifies the maximum intensity of the center color that gets blended with the boundary color. A value of 1 causes the highest possible intensity of the center color, and it is the default value. |
