## PathGradientBrush class

Encapsulates a [`Brush`](../../aspose.imaging/brush) object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited.

```csharp
public sealed class PathGradientBrush : PathGradientBrushBase
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PathGradientBrush](pathgradientbrush)(GraphicsPath) | Initializes a new instance of the [`PathGradientBrush`](../pathgradientbrush) class with the specified path. |
| [PathGradientBrush](pathgradientbrush)(PointF[]) | Initializes a new instance of the [`PathGradientBrush`](../pathgradientbrush) class with the specified points. |
| [PathGradientBrush](pathgradientbrush)(Point[]) | Initializes a new instance of the [`PathGradientBrush`](../pathgradientbrush) class with the specified points. |
| [PathGradientBrush](pathgradientbrush)(PointF[], WrapMode) | Initializes a new instance of the [`PathGradientBrush`](../pathgradientbrush) class with the specified points and wrap mode. |
| [PathGradientBrush](pathgradientbrush)(Point[], WrapMode) | Initializes a new instance of the [`PathGradientBrush`](../pathgradientbrush) class with the specified points and wrap mode. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Blend](blend) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a [`Blend`](../../aspose.imaging/blend) that specifies positions and factors that define a custom falloff for the gradient. |
| [CenterColor](centercolor) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the color at the center of the path gradient. |
| [SurroundColors](surroundcolors) { get; set; } | Gets or sets an array of colors that correspond to the points in the path this [`PathGradientBrush`](../pathgradientbrush) fills. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SetBlendTriangularShape](setblendtriangularshape)(float) | Creates a gradient with a center color and a linear falloff to one surrounding color. |
| [SetBlendTriangularShape](setblendtriangularshape)(float, float) | Creates a gradient with a center color and a linear falloff to each surrounding color. |
| [SetSigmaBellShape](setsigmabellshape)(float) | Creates a gradient brush that changes color starting from the center of the path outward to the path's boundary. The transition from one color to another is based on a bell-shaped curve. |
| [SetSigmaBellShape](setsigmabellshape)(float, float) | Creates a gradient brush that changes color starting from the center of the path outward to the path's boundary. The transition from one color to another is based on a bell-shaped curve. |

### Remarks

The center color is white by default. A user can changed this value at any time later.

The surround colors array is initialized by single element containing white color by default. The surround colors may be changed later, however at least single element is required when setting up the surround colors.

See the [`Blend`](./blend) for more details about its initialization.
