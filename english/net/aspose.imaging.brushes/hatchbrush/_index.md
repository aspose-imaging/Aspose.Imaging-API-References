| [BackgroundColor](../../aspose.imaging.brushes/hatchbrush/backgroundcolor) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the color of spaces between the hatch lines. |
| [Disposed](../../aspose.imaging/disposableobject/disposed) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this instance is disposed. |
| [ForegroundColor](../../aspose.imaging.brushes/hatchbrush/foregroundcolor) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the color of hatch lines. |
| [HatchStyle](../../aspose.imaging.brushes/hatchbrush/hatchstyle) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the hatch style of this brush. |
| [Opacity](../../aspose.imaging/brush/opacity) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the brush opacity. The value should be between 0 and 1. Value of 0 means that brush is fully visible, value of 1 means the brush is fully opaque. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| virtual [DeepClone](../../aspose.imaging/brush/deepclone)() | Creates a new deep clone of the current [`Brush`](../../aspose.imaging/brush). |
| [Dispose](../../aspose.imaging/disposableobject/dispose)() | Disposes the current instance. |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.imaging/brush/equals)(object) | Check if objects are equal. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.imaging/brush/gethashcode)() | Get hash code of the current object. |

### Examples

This example shows the creation and usage Pen objects. The example creates a new Image and draw Rectangles on Image surface.

```csharp
[C#]

//Create an instance of BmpOptions and set its various properties
Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.BmpOptions bmpOptions = new Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.BmpOptions();
bmpOptions.BitsPerPixel = 24;

//Create an instance of FileCreateSource and assign it as Source for the instance of BmpOptions
//Second Boolean parameter determines if the file to be created IsTemporal or not
bmpOptions.Source = new Aspose.Imaging.Sources.FileCreateSource(@"C:\temp\sample.bmp", false);

//Create an instance of Image at specified Path
using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Create(bmpOptions, 500, 500))
{
    //Create an instance of Graphics and initialize it with Image object
    Aspose.Imaging.Graphics graphics = new Aspose.Imaging.Graphics(image);

    //Clear the Graphics sutface with White Color
    graphics.Clear(Aspose.Imaging.Color.White);

    //Create an instance of Pen with color Red and width 5
    Aspose.Imaging.Pen pen = new Aspose.Imaging.Pen(Aspose.Imaging.Color.Red, 5f);

    //Create an instance of HatchBrush and set its properties
    Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.HatchBrush brush = new Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.HatchBrush();
    brush.BackgroundColor = Aspose.Imaging.Color.Wheat;
    brush.ForegroundColor = Aspose.Imaging.Color.Red;

    //Create an instance of Pen
    //initialize it with HatchBrush object and width
    Aspose.Imaging.Pen brusedpen = new Pen(brush, 5);

    //Draw Rectangles by specifying Pen object
    graphics.DrawRectangles(pen, new[]
    {
        new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Point(210, 210), new Aspose.Imaging.Size(100, 100)),
        new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Point(110, 110), new Aspose.Imaging.Size(100, 100)),
        new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Point(310, 310), new Aspose.Imaging.Size(100, 100))
    });

    //Draw Rectangles by specifying Pen object
    graphics.DrawRectangles(brusedpen, new[]
    {
        new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Point(310, 110), new Aspose.Imaging.Size(100, 100)),
        new Aspose.Imaging.Rectangle(new Aspose.Imaging.Point(110, 310), new Aspose.Imaging.Size(100, 100))
    });

    // save all changes.
    image.Save();
}
```
