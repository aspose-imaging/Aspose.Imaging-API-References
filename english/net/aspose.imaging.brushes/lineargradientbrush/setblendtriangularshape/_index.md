## SetBlendTriangularShape(float, float) {#setblendtriangularshape_1}

Creates a linear gradient with a center color and a linear falloff to a single color on both ends.

```csharp
public void SetBlendTriangularShape(float focus, float scale)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| focus | Single | A value from 0 through 1 that specifies the center of the gradient (the point where the gradient is composed of only the ending color). |
