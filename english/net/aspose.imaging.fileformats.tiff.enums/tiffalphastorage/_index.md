## TiffAlphaStorage enumeration

Specifies the alpha storage for tiff documents.

```csharp
public enum TiffAlphaStorage : ushort
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unspecified | `0` | The alpha is not specified and stored in the tiff file. |
| Associated | `1` | The alpha value is stored in premultiplied form. When alpha is restored there may be some rounding effects and restored value may be different from the original. |
| Unassociated | `2` | The alpha value is stored in unassociated form. That means that alpha restored is exactly the same as it was stored to the tiff. |
