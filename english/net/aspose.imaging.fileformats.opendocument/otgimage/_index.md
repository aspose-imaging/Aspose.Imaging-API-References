The following code snippet demonstrates how to convert an OTG image to PDF and other image formats.

```csharp
[C#]

string dir = "c:\\aspose.imaging\\issues\\net\\3567\\";
string inputFilePath = dir + "VariousObjectsMultiPage.otg";
Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptionsBase[] options = { new Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.PngOptions(), new Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.PdfOptions() };
foreach (Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptionsBase saveOptions in options)
{
    string extension = saveOptions is Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.PngOptions ? ".png" : ".pdf";
    using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load(inputFilePath))
    {
        Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.OtgRasterizationOptions otgRasterizationOptions = new Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.OtgRasterizationOptions();
        otgRasterizationOptions.PageSize = image.Size;
        saveOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = otgRasterizationOptions;

        image.Save(inputFilePath + extension, saveOptions);
    }
}
```
