## EmfHeaderObject class

The Header object defines the EMF metafile header. It specifies properties of the device on which the image in the metafile was created.

```csharp
public class EmfHeaderObject : EmfObject
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EmfHeaderObject](emfheaderobject)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Bounds](bounds) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a WMF RectL object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.19) that specifies the rectangular inclusive-inclusive bounds in device units of the smallest rectangle that can be drawn around the image stored in the metafile |
| [Bytes](bytes) { get; set; } | Gets or sets 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the size of the metafile, in bytes. |
| [Device](device) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a WMF SizeL object ([MS-WMF] section 2.2.2.22) that specifies the size of the reference device, in pixels |
| [Frame](frame) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a WMF RectL object that specifies the rectangular inclusive-inclusive dimensions, in .01 millimeter units, of a rectangle that surrounds the image stored in the metafile |
| [Handles](handles) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of graphics objects that will be used during the processing of the metafile |
| [Millimeters](millimeters) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a WMF SizeL object that specifies the size of the reference device, in millimeters |
| [NDesription](ndesription) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of characters in the array that contains the description of the metafile's contents. This is zero if there is no description string. |
| [NPalEntries](npalentries) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of entries in the metafile palette. The palette is located in the EMR_EOF record |
| [OffDescription](offdescription) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the offset from the beginning of this record to the array that contains the description of the metafile's contents |
| [Records](records) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of records in the metafile |
| [RecordSignature](recordsignature) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the record signature. This MUST be ENHMETA_SIGNATURE, from the FormatSignature enumeration (section 2.1.14). |
| [Reserved](reserved) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a 16-bit unsigned integer that MUST be 0x0000 and MUST be ignored |
| [Valid](valid) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this [`EmfHeaderObject`](../emfheaderobject) is valid. |
| [Version](version) { get; set; } | Gets or sets Version (4 bytes): A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies EMF metafile interoperability. This SHOULD be 0x00010000 |
