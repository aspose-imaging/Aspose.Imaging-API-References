The array contains a number of entries specified by NumStyleEntries, but it is used as if it repeated indefinitely The first entry in the array specifies the length of the first dash. The second entry specifies the length of the first gap. Thereafter, lengths of dashes and gaps alternate. If the pen type in the PenStyle field is PS_GEOMETRIC, the lengths are specified in logical units; otherwise, the lengths are specified in device units.

public int[] StyleEntry { get; set; }
