## EmfColorAdjustment.Contrast property

Gets or sets a 16-bit signed integer that specifies the amount of contrast to be applied to the source object. This value SHOULD be in the range from –100 to 100. A value of zero means contrast adjustment MUST NOT be performed.

```csharp
public short Contrast { get; set; }
```
