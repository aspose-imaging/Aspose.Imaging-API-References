## EmfColorAdjustment.Brightness property

Gets or sets a 16-bit signed integer that specifies the amount of brightness to be applied to the source object. This value SHOULD be in the range from –100 to 100. A value of zero means brightness adjustment MUST NOT be performed.

```csharp
public short Brightness { get; set; }
```
