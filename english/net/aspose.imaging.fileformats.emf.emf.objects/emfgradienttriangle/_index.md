## EmfGradientTriangle class

The GradientTriangle object defines a triangle using TriVertex objects (section 2.2.26) in an EMR_GRADIENTFILL record (section 2.3.5.12)

```csharp
public sealed class EmfGradientTriangle : EmfObject
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EmfGradientTriangle](emfgradienttriangle)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Vertex1](vertex1) { get; set; } | Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of the EMR_GRADIENTFILL record. |
| [Vertex2](vertex2) { get; set; } | Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of the EMR_GRADIENTFILL record. |
| [Vertex3](vertex3) { get; set; } | Gets or sets an index into an array of TriVertex objects that specifies a vertex of a triangle. The index MUST be smaller than the size of the array, as defined by the nVer field of the EMR_GRADIENTFILL record. |
