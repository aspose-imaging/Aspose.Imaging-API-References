## GuidPacketRepresentation structure

The packet version is used within block protocols. The following diagram represents a GUID as an opaque sequence of bytes. A GUID, also known as a UUID, is a 16-byte structure, intended to serve as a unique identifier for an object. There are three representations of a GUID, as described in the following sections.

```csharp
public struct GuidPacketRepresentation
