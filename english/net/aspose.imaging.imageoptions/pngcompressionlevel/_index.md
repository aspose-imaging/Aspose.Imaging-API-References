## PngCompressionLevel enumeration

The png compression level enum.

```csharp
public enum PngCompressionLevel
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ZipLevel0 | `0` | The data will be simply stored, with no change at all. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZipLevel1 | `1` | The fastest but least effective compression. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZipLevel2 | `2` | A little slower, but better, than level 1. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZipLevel3 | `3` | A little slower, but better, than level 2. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZipLevel4 | `4` | A little slower, but better, than level 3. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZipLevel5 | `5` | A little slower than level 4, but with better compression. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZipLevel6 | `6` | A little slower than level 5, but with better compression. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZipLevel7 | `7` | Better compression than level 6, but even slower. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZipLevel8 | `8` | Better compression than level 7, but even slower. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| ZipLevel9 | `9` | The "best" compression, where best means greatest reduction in size of the input data stream. This is also the slowest compression. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale. |
| DeflateRecomended | `10` | The most optimised compression, with a good balance of speed and compression efficiency. Uses a faster deflate implementation with no compression scale. |
