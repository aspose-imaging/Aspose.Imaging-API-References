## GraphicsPath.Flatten method (1 of 3)

Converts each curve in this path into a sequence of connected line segments.

```csharp
public void Flatten()
```

## GraphicsPath.Flatten method (2 of 3)

Applies the specified transform and then converts each curve in this [`GraphicsPath`](../../graphicspath) into a sequence of connected line segments.

```csharp
public void Flatten(Matrix matrix)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| matrix | Matrix | A [`Matrix`](../../matrix) by which to transform this [`GraphicsPath`](../../graphicspath) before flattening. |

* class [Matrix](../../matrix)
* class [GraphicsPath](../../graphicspath)
* namespace [Aspose.Imaging](../../graphicspath)
* assembly [Aspose.Imaging](../../../)

## GraphicsPath.Flatten method (3 of 3)

Converts each curve in this [`GraphicsPath`](../../graphicspath) into a sequence of connected line segments.

```csharp
public void Flatten(Matrix matrix, float flatness)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| matrix | Matrix | A [`Matrix`](../../matrix) by which to transform this [`GraphicsPath`](../../graphicspath) before flattening. |
| flatness | Single | Specifies the maximum permitted error between the curve and its flattened approximation. A value of 0.25 is the default. Reducing the flatness value will increase the number of line segments in the approximation. |
