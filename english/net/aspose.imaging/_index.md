## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AggregateException](./aggregateexception/) | Aggregates multiple exceptions. |
| [Blend](./blend/) | Defines a blend pattern. This class cannot be inherited. |
| [Brush](./brush/) | The base brush class. |
| [BuildVersionInfo](./buildversioninfo/) | Contains the current build version information. |
| [Cache](./cache/) | Contains cache settings. |
| [CmykColorHelper](./cmykcolorhelper/) | Helper methods to work with CMYK color presented as a signed 32-bit integer value. Provides the similar API as the [`CmykColor`](../aspose.imaging/cmykcolor/) struct. It's more lightweight because CMYK color is presented just as Int32 rather than structure with internal fields. Please prefer to use static methods of this class when possible instead of the deprecated [`CmykColor`](../aspose.imaging/cmykcolor/) struct. |
| [ColorBlend](./colorblend/) | Defines arrays of colors and positions used for interpolating color blending in a multicolor gradient. This class cannot be inherited. |
