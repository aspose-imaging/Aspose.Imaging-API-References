## Figure.IsClosed property

Gets or sets a value indicating whether this figure is closed. A closed figure will make a difference only in case where the first and the last figure's shapes are continuous shapes. In such case the first point of the first shape will be connected by a straight line from the last point of the last shape.

```csharp
public bool IsClosed { get; set; }
```

## Property Value

`True` if this figure is closed; otherwise, `false`.
