## DataStreamSupporter.CacheData method

Caches the data and ensures no additional data loading will be performed from the underlying [`DataStreamContainer`](../datastreamcontainer).

```csharp
public abstract void CacheData()
```

### Examples

The following example shows how image caching affects performance. In general case, reading cached data is performed faster than reading non-cached data.

```csharp
[C#]

	string dir = "c:\\temp\\";

	// Load an image from a PNG file.
	using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load(dir + "sample.png"))
	{
		// Cache all pixel data so that no additional data loading will be performed from the underlying data stream
		image.CacheData();

		System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch stopwatch = new System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch();
		stopwatch.Start();

		// Reading all pixels is pretty fast.
		Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage rasterImage = (Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage)image;
		for (int y = 0; y < image.Height; y++)
		{
			for (int x = 0; x < image.Width; x++)
			{
				int color = rasterImage.GetArgb32Pixel(x, y);
			}
		}

		stopwatch.Stop();
		System.Console.WriteLine("Reading all cached pixels took {0} ms.", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);
	}

	// Load an image from a PNG file
	using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load(dir + "sample.png"))
	{
		System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch stopwatch = new System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch();
		stopwatch.Start();

		// Reading all pixels is not as fast as when caching
		Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage rasterImage = (Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage)image;
		for (int y = 0; y < image.Height; y++)
		{
			for (int x = 0; x < image.Width; x++)
			{
				int color = rasterImage.GetArgb32Pixel(x, y);
			}
		}

		stopwatch.Stop();
		System.Console.WriteLine("Reading all pixels without preliminary caching took {0} ms.", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds);
	}

	// The output may look like this:
	// Reading all cached pixels took 1500 ms.
	// Reading all pixels without preliminary caching took 150000 ms.
```

```csharp
[VB.NET]

    Dim dir = "c:\temp\"

    ' Load an image from a PNG file.
    Using image As Aspose.Imaging.Image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load(dir & "sample.png")
        ' Cache all pixel data so that no additional data loading will be performed from the underlying data stream
        image.CacheData()

        Dim stopwatch As Stopwatch = New Stopwatch()
        stopwatch.Start()

        ' Reading all pixels is pretty fast.
        Dim rasterImage As Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage = CType(image, Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage)
        For y As Integer = 0 To image.Height - 1
            For x As Integer = 0 To image.Width - 1
                Dim color As Integer = rasterImage.GetArgb32Pixel(x, y)
            Next
        Next

        stopwatch.Stop()
        System.Console.WriteLine("Reading all cached pixels took {0} ms.", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds)
    End Using

    ' Load an image from a PNG file
    Using image As Aspose.Imaging.Image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load(dir & "sample.png")
        Dim stopwatch As Stopwatch = New Stopwatch()
        stopwatch.Start()

        ' Reading all pixels is not as fast as when caching
        Dim rasterImage As Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage = CType(image, Aspose.Imaging.RasterImage)
        For y As Integer = 0 To image.Height - 1
            For x As Integer = 0 To image.Width - 1
                Dim color As Integer = rasterImage.GetArgb32Pixel(x, y)
            Next
        Next

        stopwatch.Stop()
        System.Console.WriteLine("Reading all pixels without preliminary caching took {0} ms.", stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds)
    End Using

    ' The output may look like this:
    ' Reading all cached pixels took 1500 ms.
    ' Reading all pixels without preliminary caching took 150000 ms.
```
