## FillPolygon(Brush, PointF[]) {#fillpolygon}

Fills the interior of a polygon defined by an array of points specified by [`PointF`](../../pointf/) structures and Alternate.

```csharp
public void FillPolygon(Brush brush, PointF[] points)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush/) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf/) structures that represent the vertices of the polygon to fill. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *brush* is null. -or- *points* is null. |

### See Also

* class [Brush](../../brush/)
* struct [PointF](../../pointf/)
* class [Graphics](../)
* namespace [Aspose.Imaging](../../graphics/)

## FillPolygon(Brush, PointF[], FillMode) {#fillpolygon_1}

Fills the interior of a polygon defined by an array of points specified by [`PointF`](../../pointf/) structures using the specified fill mode.

```csharp
public void FillPolygon(Brush brush, PointF[] points, FillMode fillMode)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush/) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf/) structures that represent the vertices of the polygon to fill. |
| fillMode | FillMode | Member of the [`FillMode`](../../fillmode/) enumeration that determines the style of the fill. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *brush* is null. -or- *points* is null. |
