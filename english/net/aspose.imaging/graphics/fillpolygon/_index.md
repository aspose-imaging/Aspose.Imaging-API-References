## Graphics.FillPolygon method (1 of 4)

Fills the interior of a polygon defined by an array of points specified by [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures and Alternate.

```csharp
public void FillPolygon(Brush brush, PointF[] points)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures that represent the vertices of the polygon to fill. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *brush* is null. -or- *points* is null. |

### See Also

* class [Brush](../../brush)
* struct [PointF](../../pointf)
* class [Graphics](../../graphics)
* namespace [Aspose.Imaging](../../graphics)
* assembly [Aspose.Imaging](../../../)

## Graphics.FillPolygon method (2 of 4)

Fills the interior of a polygon defined by an array of points specified by [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures using the specified fill mode.

```csharp
public void FillPolygon(Brush brush, PointF[] points, FillMode fillMode)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures that represent the vertices of the polygon to fill. |
| fillMode | FillMode | Member of the [`FillMode`](../../fillmode) enumeration that determines the style of the fill. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *brush* is null. -or- *points* is null. |
