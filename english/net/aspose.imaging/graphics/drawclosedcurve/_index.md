## Graphics.DrawClosedCurve method (1 of 4)

Draws a closed cardinal spline defined by an array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures. This method uses a default tension of 0.5 and Alternate fill mode.

```csharp
public void DrawClosedCurve(Pen pen, PointF[] points)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | [`Pen`](../../pen) that determines the color, width, and height of the curve. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures that define the spline. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *pen* is null. -or- *points* is null. |

### See Also

* class [Pen](../../pen)
* struct [PointF](../../pointf)
* class [Graphics](../../graphics)
* namespace [Aspose.Imaging](../../graphics)
* assembly [Aspose.Imaging](../../../)

## Graphics.DrawClosedCurve method (2 of 4)

Draws a closed cardinal spline defined by an array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures using a specified tension. This method uses a default Alternate fill mode.

```csharp
public void DrawClosedCurve(Pen pen, PointF[] points, float tension)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pen | Pen | [`Pen`](../../pen) that determines the color, width, and height of the curve. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures that define the spline. |
| tension | Single | Value greater than or equal to 0.0F that specifies the tension of the curve. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *pen* is null. -or- *points* is null. |

### See Also

* class [Pen](../../pen)
* struct [PointF](../../pointf)
* class [Graphics](../../graphics)
* namespace [Aspose.Imaging](../../graphics)
* assembly [Aspose.Imaging](../../../)
