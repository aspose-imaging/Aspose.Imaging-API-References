## Graphics.FillClosedCurve method (1 of 6)

Fills the interior of a closed cardinal spline curve defined by an array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures. This method uses a default tension of 0.5 and Alternate fill mode.

```csharp
public void FillClosedCurve(Brush brush, PointF[] points)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures that define the spline. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *brush* is null. -or- *points* is null. |

### See Also

* class [Brush](../../brush)
* struct [PointF](../../pointf)
* class [Graphics](../../graphics)
* namespace [Aspose.Imaging](../../graphics)
* assembly [Aspose.Imaging](../../../)

## Graphics.FillClosedCurve method (2 of 6)

Fills the interior of a closed cardinal spline curve defined by an array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures using the specified fill mode. This method uses a default tension of 0.5.

```csharp
public void FillClosedCurve(Brush brush, PointF[] points, FillMode fillmode)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures that define the spline. |
| fillmode | FillMode | Member of the [`FillMode`](../../fillmode) enumeration that determines how the curve is filled. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *brush* is null. -or- *points* is null. |

Fills the interior of a closed cardinal spline curve defined by an array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures using the specified fill mode and tension.

```csharp
public void FillClosedCurve(Brush brush, PointF[] points, FillMode fillmode, float tension)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | A [`Brush`](../../brush) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf) structures that define the spline. |
| fillmode | FillMode | Member of the [`FillMode`](../../fillmode) enumeration that determines how the curve is filled. |
| tension | Single | Value greater than or equal to 0.0F that specifies the tension of the curve. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
