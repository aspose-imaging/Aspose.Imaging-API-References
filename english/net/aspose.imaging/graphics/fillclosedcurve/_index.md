## FillClosedCurve(Brush, PointF[]) {#fillclosedcurve}

Fills the interior of a closed cardinal spline curve defined by an array of [`PointF`](../../pointf/) structures. This method uses a default tension of 0.5 and Alternate fill mode.

```csharp
public void FillClosedCurve(Brush brush, PointF[] points)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush/) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf/) structures that define the spline. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *brush* is null. -or- *points* is null. |

### See Also

* class [Brush](../../brush/)
* struct [PointF](../../pointf/)

```csharp
public void FillClosedCurve(Brush brush, PointF[] points, FillMode fillMode)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush/) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| points | PointF[] | Array of [`PointF`](../../pointf/) structures that define the spline. |
| fillMode | FillMode | Member of the [`FillMode`](../../fillmode/) enumeration that determines how the curve is filled. |

### Exceptions
