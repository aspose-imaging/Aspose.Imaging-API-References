## Graphics.FillEllipse method (1 of 4)

Fills the interior of an ellipse defined by a bounding rectangle specified by a [`RectangleF`](../../rectanglef) structure.

```csharp
public void FillEllipse(Brush brush, RectangleF rect)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| rect | RectangleF | [`RectangleF`](../../rectanglef) structure that represents the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *brush* is null. |

### See Also

* class [Brush](../../brush)
* struct [RectangleF](../../rectanglef)
* class [Graphics](../../graphics)

## Graphics.FillEllipse method (2 of 4)

Fills the interior of an ellipse defined by a bounding rectangle specified by a pair of coordinates, a width, and a height.

```csharp
public void FillEllipse(Brush brush, float x, float y, float width, float height)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brush | Brush | [`Brush`](../../brush) that determines the characteristics of the fill. |
| x | Single | The x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| y | Single | The y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| width | Single | Width of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse. |
| height | Single | Height of the bounding rectangle that defines the ellipse. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *brush* is null. |
