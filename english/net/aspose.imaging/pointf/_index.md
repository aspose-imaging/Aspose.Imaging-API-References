## PointF structure

Represents an ordered pair of floating-point x- and y-coordinates that defines a point in a two-dimensional plane.

```csharp
public struct PointF
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PointF](pointf)(float, float) | Initializes a new instance of the [`PointF`](../pointf) structure with the specified coordinates. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Empty](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/empty) { get; } | Gets a new instance of the [`PointF`](../pointf) structure that has [`X`](./x) and [`Y`](./y) values set to zero. |
| [IsEmpty](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/isempty) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this [`PointF`](../pointf) is empty. |
| [X](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/x) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the x-coordinate of this [`PointF`](../pointf). |
| [Y](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/y) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the y-coordinate of this [`PointF`](../pointf). |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Add](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/add)(PointF, Size) | Translates a given [`PointF`](../pointf) by the specified [`Size`](../size). |
| static [Add](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/add)(PointF, SizeF) | Translates a given [`PointF`](../pointf) by a specified [`SizeF`](../sizef). |
| static [Subtract](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/subtract)(PointF, Size) | Translates a [`PointF`](../pointf) by the negative of a specified size. |
| static [Subtract](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/subtract)(PointF, SizeF) | Translates a [`PointF`](../pointf) by the negative of a specified size. |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/equals)(object) | Specifies whether this [`PointF`](../pointf) contains the same coordinates as the specified Object. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/gethashcode)() | Returns a hash code for this [`PointF`](../pointf) structure. |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/tostring)() | Converts this [`PointF`](../pointf) to a human readable string. |
| [operator +](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/op_addition) | Translates a [`PointF`](../pointf) by a given [`Size`](../size). (2 operators) |
| [operator ==](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/op_equality) | Compares two [`PointF`](../pointf) structures. The result specifies whether the values of the [`X`](./x) and [`Y`](./y) properties of the two [`PointF`](../pointf) structures are equal. |
| [operator !=](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/op_inequality) | Determines whether the coordinates of the specified points are not equal. |
| [operator -](../../aspose.imaging/pointf/op_subtraction) | Translates a [`PointF`](../pointf) by the negative of a given [`Size`](../size). (2 operators) |
