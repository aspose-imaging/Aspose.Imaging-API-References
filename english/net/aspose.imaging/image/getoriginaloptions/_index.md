## Image.GetOriginalOptions method

Gets the options based on the original file settings. This can be helpful to keep bit-depth and other parameters of the original image unchanged. For example, if we load a black-white PNG image with 1 bit per pixel and then save it using the [`Save`](../../datastreamsupporter/save) method, the output PNG image with 8-bit per pixel will be produced. To avoid it and save PNG image with 1-bit per pixel, use this method to get corresponding saving options and pass them to the [`Save`](../save) method as the second parameter.

```csharp
public virtual ImageOptionsBase GetOriginalOptions()
```

## Return Value

The options based on the original file settings.
