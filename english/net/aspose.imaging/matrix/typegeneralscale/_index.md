## Matrix.TypeGeneralScale field

A general scale multiplies the length of vectors by different amounts in the x and y directions without changing the angle between perpendicular vectors. This flag bit is mutually exclusive with the TypeUniformScale flag.

```csharp
public const int TypeGeneralScale;
```
