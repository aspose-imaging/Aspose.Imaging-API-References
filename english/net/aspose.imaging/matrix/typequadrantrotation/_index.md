## Matrix.TypeQuadrantRotation field

This flag bit indicates that the transform defined by this object performs a quadrant rotation by some multiple of 90 degrees in addition to the conversions indicated by other flag bits. A rotation changes the angles of vectors by the same amount regardless of the original direction of the vector and without changing the length of the vector. This flag bit is mutually exclusive with the TypeGeneralRotation flag.

```csharp
public const int TypeQuadrantRotation;
```
