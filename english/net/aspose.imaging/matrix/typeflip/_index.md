description: Matrix field. This flag bit indicates that the transform defined by this object performs a mirror image flip about some axis which changes the normally right handed coordinate system into a left handed system in addition to the conversions indicated by other flag bits. A right handed coordinate system is one where the positive X axis rotates counterclockwise to overlay the positive Y axis similar to the direction that the fingers on your right hand curl when you stare end on at your thumb. A left handed coordinate system is one where the positive X axis rotates clockwise to overlay the positive Y axis similar to the direction that the fingers on your left hand curl. There is no mathematical way to determine the angle of the original flipping or mirroring transformation since all angles of flip are identical given an appropriate adjusting rotation. NOTE TypeFlip was added after GENERAL_TRANSFORM was in public circulation and the flag bits could no longer be conveniently renumbered without introducing binary incompatibility in outside code

## Matrix.TypeFlip field

This flag bit indicates that the transform defined by this object performs a mirror image flip about some axis which changes the normally right handed coordinate system into a left handed system in addition to the conversions indicated by other flag bits. A right handed coordinate system is one where the positive X axis rotates counterclockwise to overlay the positive Y axis similar to the direction that the fingers on your right hand curl when you stare end on at your thumb. A left handed coordinate system is one where the positive X axis rotates clockwise to overlay the positive Y axis similar to the direction that the fingers on your left hand curl. There is no mathematical way to determine the angle of the original flipping or mirroring transformation since all angles of flip are identical given an appropriate adjusting rotation. NOTE: TypeFlip was added after GENERAL_TRANSFORM was in public circulation and the flag bits could no longer be conveniently renumbered without introducing binary incompatibility in outside code.

```csharp
public const int TypeFlip;
```
