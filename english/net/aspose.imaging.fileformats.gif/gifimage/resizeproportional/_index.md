## GifImage.ResizeProportional method

Proportional resizing maintains the aspect ratio of the image while adjusting its size, ensuring that the image does not appear stretched or distorted. This method resizes the image proportionally, scaling both the width and height by the same factor. The proportional resize will resize each frame according to the ratio of *newWidth*/width and *newHeight*/height.

```csharp
public void ResizeProportional(int newWidth, int newHeight, ResizeType resizeType)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| newWidth | Int32 | The new width. |
| newHeight | Int32 | The new height. |
| resizeType | ResizeType | The resize type. |
