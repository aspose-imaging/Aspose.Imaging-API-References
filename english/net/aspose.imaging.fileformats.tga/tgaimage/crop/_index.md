## TgaImage.Crop method (2 of 2)

Crop the image by specifying shifts for the left, right, top, and bottom boundaries. This method allows you to trim the image by moving its boundaries independently along the horizontal and vertical axes. By adjusting these shifts, you can precisely control which portions of the image to retain, effectively cropping it to the desired dimensions.

```csharp
public override void Crop(int leftShift, int rightShift, int topShift, int bottomShift)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| leftShift | Int32 | The left shift. |
| rightShift | Int32 | The right shift. |
| topShift | Int32 | The top shift. |
| bottomShift | Int32 | The bottom shift. |
