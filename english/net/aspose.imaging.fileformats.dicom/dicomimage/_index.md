        ColorType = ColorType.Rgb24Bit,
        Compression = new Compression

            Type = CompressionType.Jpeg,
            Jpeg = new JpegOptions
            {
                CompressionType = JpegCompressionMode.Baseline,
                SampleRoundingMode = SampleRoundingMode.Truncate,
                Quality = 50

This example shows how to load a DICOM image from a file stream.

```csharp
[C#]

string dir = "c:\\temp\\";

// Load a DICOM image from a file stream.
using (System.IO.Stream stream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(dir + "sample.dicom"))
{
    using (Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Dicom.DicomImage dicomImage = new Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Dicom.DicomImage(stream))
    {
        // Save each page as an individual PNG image.                    
        foreach (Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Dicom.DicomPage dicomPage in dicomImage.DicomPages)
        {
            // Generate a file name based on the page index.
            string fileName = string.Format("sample.{0}.png", dicomPage.Index);

            // A DICOM page is a raster image, so all allowed operations with a raster image are applicable to a DICOM page.
            dicomPage.Save(dir + fileName, new Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.PngOptions());
        }
    }
}
```

Create a multi-page Dicom image.

```csharp
[C#]

using (DicomImage image = (DicomImage)Image.Create(
        new DicomOptions() { Source = new StreamSource(new MemoryStream()) },
        100,
        100))
{
    // Draw something using vector graphics
    Graphics graphics = new Graphics(image);
    graphics.FillRectangle(new SolidBrush(Color.BlueViolet), image.Bounds);
    graphics.FillRectangle(new SolidBrush(Color.Aqua), 10, 20, 50, 20);
    graphics.FillEllipse(new SolidBrush(Color.Orange), 30, 50, 70, 30);

    // Save the pixels of the drawn image. They are now on the first page of the Dicom image.
    int[] pixels = image.LoadArgb32Pixels(image.Bounds);

    // Add a few pages after, making them darker
    for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++)
    {
        DicomPage page = image.AddPage();
        page.SaveArgb32Pixels(page.Bounds, pixels);
        page.AdjustBrightness(i * 30);
    }

    // Add a few pages in front of the main page, making them brighter
    for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++)
    {
        DicomPage page = image.InsertPage(0);
        page.SaveArgb32Pixels(page.Bounds, pixels);
        page.AdjustBrightness(-i * 30);
    }

    // Save the created multi-page image to the output file
    image.Save("MultiPage.dcm");
}
```
