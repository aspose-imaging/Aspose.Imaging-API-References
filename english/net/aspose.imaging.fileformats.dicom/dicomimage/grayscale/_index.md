## DicomImage.Grayscale method

Transformation of an image to its grayscale representation

```csharp
public override void Grayscale()
```

### Examples

The following example transforms a colored DICOM image to its grayscale representation. Grayscale images are composed exclusively of shades of gray and carry only intensity information.

```csharp
[C#]

string dir = "c:\\temp\\";

using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load(dir + "sample.dicom"))
{
    Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Dicom.DicomImage dicomImage = (Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Dicom.DicomImage)image;

    dicomImage.Grayscale();
    dicomImage.Save(dir + "sample.Grayscale.png", new Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.PngOptions());
}
```
