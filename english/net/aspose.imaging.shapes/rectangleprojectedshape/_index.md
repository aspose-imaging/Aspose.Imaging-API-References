## RectangleProjectedShape class

Represents a shape which is projected over rectangle turned to a particular orientation. Specified by four points which can be rotated in space maintaining the same edges length and 90 degrees between adjacent edges.

```csharp
public abstract class RectangleProjectedShape : Shape
```

## Constructors
