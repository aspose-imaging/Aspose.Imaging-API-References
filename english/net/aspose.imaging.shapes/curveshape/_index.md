## CurveShape class

Represents a curved spline shape.

```csharp
public sealed class CurveShape : PolygonShape
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CurveShape](curveshape)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`CurveShape`](../curveshape) class. |
| [CurveShape](curveshape)(PointF[]) | Initializes a new instance of the [`CurveShape`](../curveshape) class. The default tension of 0.5 is used. |
| [CurveShape](curveshape)(PointF[], bool) | Initializes a new instance of the [`CurveShape`](../curveshape) class. The default tension of 0.5 is used. |
| [CurveShape](curveshape)(PointF[], float) | Initializes a new instance of the [`CurveShape`](../curveshape) class. |
| [CurveShape](curveshape)(PointF[], float, bool) | Initializes a new instance of the [`CurveShape`](../curveshape) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| override [Bounds](../../aspose.imaging.shapes/curveshape/bounds) { get; } | Gets the object's bounds. |
| override [Center](../../aspose.imaging.shapes/curveshape/center) { get; } | Gets the shape's center. |
| virtual [EndPoint](../../aspose.imaging.shapes/polygonshape/endpoint) { get; } | Gets the ending shape point. |
| override [HasSegments](../../aspose.imaging.shapes/polygonshape/hassegments) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether shape has segments. |
| [IsClosed](../../aspose.imaging.shapes/polygonshape/isclosed) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value indicating whether shape is closed. |
| [Points](../../aspose.imaging.shapes/polygonshape/points) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the curve points. |
| override [Segments](../../aspose.imaging.shapes/curveshape/segments) { get; } | Gets the shape segments. |
| virtual [StartPoint](../../aspose.imaging.shapes/polygonshape/startpoint) { get; } | Gets the starting shape point. |
| [Tension](../../aspose.imaging.shapes/curveshape/tension) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the curve tension. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
