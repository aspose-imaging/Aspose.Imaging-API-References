## CurveShape(PointF[]) {#constructor_1}

Initializes a new instance of the [`CurveShape`](../) class. The default tension of 0.5 is used.

```csharp
public CurveShape(PointF[] points)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| points | PointF[] | The points array. |

## CurveShape(PointF[], bool) {#constructor_2}

Initializes a new instance of the [`CurveShape`](../) class. The default tension of 0.5 is used.

```csharp
public CurveShape(PointF[] points, bool isClosed)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| points | PointF[] | The points array. |
| isClosed | Boolean | if set to `true` the curve is closed. |

```csharp
public CurveShape(PointF[] points, float tension)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| points | PointF[] | The points array. |
| tension | Single | The curve tension. |
