## EmfPlusPixelOffsetMode enumeration

The PixelOffsetMode enumeration defines how pixels are offset, which specifies the trade-off between rendering speed and quality.

```csharp
public enum EmfPlusPixelOffsetMode : byte
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PixelOffsetModeDefault | `0` | Pixels are centered on integer coordinates, specifying speed over quality. |
| PixelOffsetModeHighSpeed | `1` | Pixels are centered on integer coordinates, as with PixelOffsetModeNone. Higher speed at the expense of quality is specified. |
| PixelOffsetModeHighQuality | `2` | Pixels are centered on half-integer coordinates, as with PixelOffsetModeHalf. Higher quality at the expense of speed is specified. |
| PixelOffsetModeNone | `3` | Pixels are centered on the origin, which means that the pixel covers the area from -0.5 to 0.5 on both the x and y axes and its center is at (0,0). |
| PixelOffsetModeHalf | `4` | Pixels are centered on half-integer coordinates, which means that the pixel covers the area from 0 to 1 on both the x and y axes and its center is at (0.5,0.5). By offsetting pixels during rendering, the render quality can be improved at the cost of render speed. |
