## EmfPlusPenAlignment enumeration

The PenAlignment enumeration defines the distribution of the width of the pen with respect to the line being drawn.

```csharp
public enum EmfPlusPenAlignment
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PenAlignmentCenter | `0` | Specifies that the EmfPlusPen object is centered over the theoretical line. |
| PenAlignmentInset | `1` | Specifies that the pen is positioned on the inside of the theoretical line. |
| PenAlignmentLeft | `2` | Specifies that the pen is positioned to the left of the theoretical line. |
| PenAlignmentOutset | `3` | Specifies that the pen is positioned on the outside of the theoretical line. |
| PenAlignmentRight | `4` | Specifies that the pen is positioned to the right of the theoretical line. |

### Remarks

Graphics pens are specified by [`EmfPlusPen`](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.objects/emfpluspen) objects (section 2.2.1.7). Pen alignment can be visualized by considering a theoretical one-dimensional line drawn between two specified points. The pen alignment determines the proportion of pen width that is orthogonal to the theoretical line.
