## EmfPlusLineJoinType enumeration

The LineJoinType enumeration defines ways to join two lines that are drawn by the same graphics pen and whose ends meet.

```csharp
public enum EmfPlusLineJoinType
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LineJoinTypeMiter | `0` | Specifies a mitered line join. |
| LineJoinTypeBevel | `1` | Specifies a beveled line join. |
| LineJoinTypeRound | `2` | Specifies a rounded line join. |
| LineJoinTypeMiterClipped | `3` | Specifies a clipped mitered line join. |

## Remarks

Graphics lines are specified by [`EmfPlusPen`](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.objects/emfpluspen/) objects (section 2.2.1.7). A line join makes the intersection of the two line ends look more continuous.
