## EmfPlusPixelFormat enumeration

The PixelFormat enumeration defines pixel formats that are supported in EMF+ bitmaps.

```csharp
public enum EmfPlusPixelFormat
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PixelFormatUndefined | `0` | The format is not specified. |
| PixelFormat1bppIndexed | `196865` | The format is monochrome, and a color palette lookup table is used. |
| PixelFormat4bppIndexed | `197634` | The format is 16-color, and a color palette lookup table is used. |
| PixelFormat8bppIndexed | `198659` | The format is 256-color, and a color palette lookup table is used. |
| PixelFormat16bppGrayScale | `1052676` | The format is 16 bits per pixel, grayscale. |
| PixelFormat16bppRGB555 | `135173` | The format is 16 bits per pixel; 5 bits each are used for the red, green, and blue components. The remaining bit is not used. |
| PixelFormat16bppRGB565 | `135174` | The format is 16 bits per pixel; 5 bits are used for the red component, 6 bits for the green component, and 5 bits for the blue component. |
| PixelFormat16bppARGB1555 | `397319` | The format is 16 bits per pixel; 1 bit is used for the alpha component, and 5 bits each are used for the red, green, and blue components. |
| PixelFormat24bppRGB | `137224` | The format is 24 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the red, green, and blue components. |
| PixelFormat32bppRGB | `139273` | The format is 32 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the red, green, and blue components. The remaining 8 bits are not used. |
| PixelFormat32bppARGB | `2498570` | The format is 32 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the alpha, red, green, and blue components. |
| PixelFormat32bppPARGB | `925707` | The format is 32 bits per pixel; 8 bits each are used for the alpha, red, green, and blue components. The red, green, and blue components are premultiplied according to the alpha component. |
| PixelFormat48bppRGB | `1060876` | The format is 48 bits per pixel; 16 bits each are used for the red, green, and blue components. |
| PixelFormat64bppARGB | `3424269` | The format is 64 bits per pixel; 16 bits each are used for the alpha, red, green, and blue components. |
| PixelFormat64bppPARGB | `1720334` | The format is 64 bits per pixel; 16 bits each are used for the alpha, red, green, and blue components. The red, green, and blue components are premultiplied according to the alpha component. |
