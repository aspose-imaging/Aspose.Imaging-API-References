## TiffImage.Grayscale method

Convert the image to its grayscale representation, transforming it into a single-channel image where each pixel represents intensity. Integrate this method into your image processing pipeline to simplify analysis and enhance compatibility with grayscale-based algorithms, facilitating various computer vision and image analysis tasks within your application.

```csharp
public override void Grayscale()
```

### Examples

The following example transforms a colored TIFF image to its grayscale representation. Grayscale images are composed exclusively of shades of gray and carry only intensity information.

```csharp
[C#]

string dir = "c:\\temp\\";

using (Aspose.Imaging.Image image = Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load(dir + "sample.tif"))
{
    Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Tiff.TiffImage tiffImage = (Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Tiff.TiffImage)image;

    tiffImage.Grayscale();
    tiffImage.Save(dir + "sample.Grayscale.png", new Aspose.Imaging.ImageOptions.PngOptions());
}
```
