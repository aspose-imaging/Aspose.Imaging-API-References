## ApngImage.GetOriginalOptions method

Retrieve options based on the original file settings effortlessly with this intuitive method. Perfect for developers seeking to access and utilize settings that align with the characteristics of the original file. This can be helpful to keep bit-depth and other parameters of the original image unchanged. For example, if we load a black-white PNG image with 1 bit per pixel and then save it using the [`Save`](../../../aspose.imaging/datastreamsupporter/save/) method, the output PNG image with 8-bit per pixel will be produced. To avoid it and save PNG image with 1-bit per pixel, use this method to get corresponding saving options and pass them to the [`Save`](../../../aspose.imaging/image/save/) method as the second parameter.

```csharp
public override ImageOptionsBase GetOriginalOptions()
```

### Return Value

The options based on the original file settings.
