| --- | --- |
| override [CacheData](../../aspose.imaging.fileformats.cdr/cdrimage/cachedata/)() | Effortlessly cache the data to prevent additional loading from the underlying source with this user-friendly method. Ideal for developers seeking to optimize performance by preloading data, ensuring faster access and smoother operation in their applications. [`DataStreamContainer`](../../aspose.imaging/datastreamsupporter/datastreamcontainer/). |
| [CanSave](../../aspose.imaging/image/cansave/)(ImageOptionsBase) | Determines whether image can be saved to the specified file format represented by the passed save options. |
| override [Crop](../../aspose.imaging/vectormultipageimage/crop/)(Rectangle) | Crops the specified rectangle. |
| virtual [Crop](../../aspose.imaging/image/crop/)(int, int, int, int) | Crop image with shifts. |

## Examples

The following example shows how to cache all pages of a CDR image.

```csharp
[C#]

string dir = "c:\\temp\\";

// Load an image from a CDR file.
using (Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Cdr.CdrImage image = (Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Cdr.CdrImage)Aspose.Imaging.Image.Load(dir + "sample.cdr"))
{
    // This call caches only the default page.
    image.CacheData();

    // Cache all pages so that no additional data loading will be performed from the underlying data stream.
    foreach (Aspose.Imaging.FileFormats.Cdr.CdrImagePage page in image.Pages)
    {
        page.CacheData();
    }
}
```
