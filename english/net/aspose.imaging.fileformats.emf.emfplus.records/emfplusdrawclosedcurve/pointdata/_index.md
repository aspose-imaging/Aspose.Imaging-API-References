## EmfPlusDrawClosedCurve.PointData property

Gets or sets the point data An array of Count points that specify the endpoints of the lines that define the spline. In a closed cardinal spline, the curve continues through the last point in the PointData array and connects with the first point in the array. The type of data in this array is specified by the Flags field, as follows: Data Type Meaning EmfPlusPointR object (section 2.2.2.37) If the P flag is set in the Flags, the points specify relative locations. EmfPlusPointF object (section 2.2.2.36) If the P and C bits are set in the Flags field, the points specify absolute locations. EmfPlusPoint object (section 2.2.2.35) If the P bit is clear and the C bit is set in the Flags field, the points specify relative locations.

```csharp
public PointF[] PointData { get; set; }
```
