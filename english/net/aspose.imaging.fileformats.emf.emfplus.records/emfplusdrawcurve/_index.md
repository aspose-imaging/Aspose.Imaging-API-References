## EmfPlusDrawCurve class

The EmfPlusDrawCurve record specifies drawing a cardinal spline NOTE: ObjectID (1 byte): The index of an EmfPlusPen object (section 2.2.1.7) in the EMF+ Object Table to draw the curve. The value MUST be zero to 63, inclusive.

```csharp
public sealed class EmfPlusDrawCurve : EmfPlusDrawingRecordType
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EmfPlusDrawCurve](emfplusdrawcurve)(EmfPlusRecord) | Initializes a new instance of the [`EmfPlusDrawCurve`](../emfplusdrawcurve) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Compressed](compressed) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value indicating whether this [`EmfPlusDrawClosedCurve`](../emfplusdrawclosedcurve) is compressed. This bit indicates whether the PointData field specifies compressed data. If set, PointData specifies absolute locations in the coordinate space with 16-bit integer coordinates. If clear, PointData specifies absolute locations in the coordinate space with 32-bit floating-point coordinates Note If the Relative flag (below) is set, this flag is undefined and MUST be ignored |
| [NumSegments](numsegments) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the segments count A 32-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of line segments making up the spline. |
| [ObjectId](objectid) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the object identifier. The index of an EmfPlusPen object (section 2.2.1.7) in the EMF+ Object Table to draw the curve. The value MUST be zero to 63, inclusive. |
| [PointData](pointdata) { get; set; } | Gets or sets an array of either 32-bit signed integers or 32-bit floating-point numbers of Count length that defines coordinate values of the endpoints of the lines to be stroked. |
| [Tension](tension) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the tension A 32-bit floating point number that specifies how tightly the spline bends as it passes through the points. A value of 0 specifies that the spline is a sequence of straight lines. As the value increases, the curve becomes more rounded. For more information, see [SPLINE77] and [PETZOLD]. |
