## EmfPlusDrawDriverString.GlyphPos property

Gets or sets the glyph positions array An array of EmfPlusPointF objects (section 2.2.2.36) that specify the output position of each character glyph. There MUST be GlyphCount elements, which have a one-to-one correspondence with the elements in the Glyphs array. Glyph positions are calculated from the position of the first glyph if the DriverStringOptionsRealizedAdvance flag in DriverStringOptions flags is set. In this case, GlyphPos specifies the position of the first glyph only.

```csharp
public PointF[] GlyphPos { get; set; }
```
