description: EmfPlusFillPie property. Gets or sets the sweep angle A 32bit floatingpoint value that specifies the extent of the arc that defines the pie wedge to draw as an angle in degrees measured from the starting point defined by the StartAngle value. Any value is acceptable but it MUST be clamped to 360.0 to 360.0 inclusive. A positive value indicates that the sweep is defined in a clockwise direction and a negative value indicates that the sweep is defined in a counterclockwise direction

## EmfPlusFillPie.SweepAngle property

Gets or sets the sweep angle A 32-bit floating-point value that specifies the extent of the arc that defines the pie wedge to draw, as an angle in degrees measured from the starting point defined by the StartAngle value. Any value is acceptable, but it MUST be clamped to -360.0 to 360.0 inclusive. A positive value indicates that the sweep is defined in a clockwise direction, and a negative value indicates that the sweep is defined in a counter-clockwise direction.

```csharp
public float SweepAngle { get; set; }
```
