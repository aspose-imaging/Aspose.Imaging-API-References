## WebPImage.BinarizeBradley method

Apply binarization to the image using Bradley's adaptive thresholding algorithm with integral image thresholding. This method dynamically computes local thresholds based on the image's neighborhood, enhancing adaptability to varying lighting conditions and ensuring robust segmentation for subsequent processing tasks within your application.

```csharp
public override void BinarizeBradley(double brightnessDifference, int windowSize)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brightnessDifference | Double | The brightness difference between pixel and the average of an s x s window of pixels centered around this pixel. |
| windowSize | Int32 | The size of s x s window of pixels centered around this pixel |
