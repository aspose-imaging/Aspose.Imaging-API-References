## WebPImage.BinarizeFixed method

Perform binarization on the image using a predefined threshold value, converting it into a binary image where pixels are classified as foreground or background based on their intensity relative to the threshold. Integrate this method into your image processing workflow to facilitate segmentation and feature extraction tasks, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of subsequent analysis within your application.

```csharp
public override void BinarizeFixed(byte threshold)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| threshold | Byte | Threshold value. If corresponding gray value of a pixel is greater than threshold, a value of 255 will be assigned to it, 0 otherwise. |
