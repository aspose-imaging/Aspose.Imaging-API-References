## EmfStretchMode enumeration

The StretchMode enumeration is used to specify how color data is added to or removed from bitmaps that are stretched or compressed.

```csharp
public enum EmfStretchMode
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| STRETCH_ANDSCANS | `1` | Performs a Boolean AND operation using the color values for the eliminated and existing pixels. If the bitmap is a monochrome bitmap, this mode preserves black pixels at the expense of white pixels |
| STRETCH_ORSCANS | `2` | Performs a Boolean OR operation using the color values for the eliminated and existing pixels. If the bitmap is a monochrome bitmap, this mode preserves white pixels at the expense of black pixels. |
| STRETCH_DELETESCANS | `3` | Deletes the pixels. This mode deletes all eliminated lines of pixels without trying to preserve their information. |
| STRETCH_HALFTONE | `4` | Maps pixels from the source rectangle into blocks of pixels in the destination rectangle. The average color over the destination block of pixels approximates the color of the source pixels. |
