The namespace contains types [MS-EMF]: Enhanced Metafile Format. 2.1 EMF Enumerations

## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EmfArcDirection](./emfarcdirection) | The ArcDirection enumeration is used in setting the drawing direction for arc and rectangle output. |
| [EmfArmStyle](./emfarmstyle) | The ArmStyle enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces. |
| [EmfBackgroundMode](./emfbackgroundmode) | The BackgroundMode enumeration is used to specify the background mode to be used with text, hatched brushes, and pen styles that are not solid.The background mode determines how to combine the background with foreground text, hatched brushes, and pen styles that are not solid lines. |
| [EmfColorAdjustmentEnum](./emfcoloradjustmentenum) | The ColorAdjustment enumeration is used to specify how the output image should be prepared when the stretch mode is HALFTONE. |
| [EmfColorMatchToTarget](./emfcolormatchtotarget) | The ColorMatchToTarget enumeration is used to determine whether a color profile has been embedded in the metafile. |
| [EmfColorSpace](./emfcolorspace) | The ColorSpace enumeration is used to specify when to turn color proofing on and off, and when to delete transforms. |
| [EmfContrast](./emfcontrast) | The Contrast enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces. |
| [EmfDibColors](./emfdibcolors) | The DIBColors enumeration defines how to interpret the values in the color table of a DIB. |
| [EmfEmrComment](./emfemrcomment) | The EmrComment enumeration defines the types of data that a public comment record can contain, as specified in section 2.3.3.4. |
| [EmfExtTextOutOptions](./emfexttextoutoptions) | The ExtTextOutOptions enumeration specifies parameters that control various aspects of the output of text by EMR_SMALLTEXTOUT(section 2.3.5.37) records and in EmrText objects. |
| [EmfFamilyType](./emffamilytype) | The FamilyType enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces. |
| [EmfFloodFill](./emffloodfill) | The FloodFill enumeration defines values that specify how to determine the area for a flood fill operation. |
| [EmfFormatSignature](./emfformatsignature) | The FormatSignature enumeration defines values that are used to identify the format of embedded data in EMF records. |
| [EmfGradientFill](./emfgradientfill) | The GradientFill enumeration defines the modes for gradient fill operations. |
| [EmfGraphicsMode](./emfgraphicsmode) | The GraphicsMode enumeration is used to specify how to interpret shape data such as rectangle coordinates. |
| [EmfHatchStyle](./emfhatchstyle) | The HatchStyle enumeration is an extension to the WMF HatchStyle enumeration ([MS-WMF] section 2.1.1.12). |
| [EmfIcmMode](./emficmmode) | The ICMMode enumeration defines values that specify when to turn on and off ICM. |
| [EmfIlluminant](./emfilluminant) | The Illuminant enumeration defines values that specify the illuminant value of an image, which determines the standard light source under which the image is viewed so that the color can be adjusted appropriately. |
| [EmfLetterform](./emfletterform) | The Letterform enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces. |
| [EmfLogFontWeight](./emflogfontweight) | The [`EmfLogFont`](aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emf.objects/emflogfont) Weight. |
| [EmfMapMode](./emfmapmode) | The MapMode enumeration is used to define the unit of measure for transforming page space units into device space units and for defining the orientation of the drawing axes. |
| [EmfMetafileVersion](./emfmetafileversion) | The MetafileVersion enumeration defines the interoperability version for EMF metafile. |
| [EmfMidLine](./emfmidline) | The MidLine enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces. |
| [EmfModifyWorldTransformMode](./emfmodifyworldtransformmode) | The ModifyWorldTransformMode enumeration defines modes for using specified transform data to modify the world-space to page-space transform that is currently defined in the playback device context. |
| [EmfPenStyle](./emfpenstyle) | The PenStyle enumeration defines the attributes of pens that can be used in graphics operations. A pen style is a combination of pen type, line style, line cap, and line join. |
| [EmfPointEnum](./emfpointenum) | The Point enumeration is used to specify how a point is to be used in a drawing call. |
| [EmfPolygonFillMode](./emfpolygonfillmode) | The PolygonFillMode enumeration defines values that specify how to calculate the region of a polygon that is to be filled. |
| [EmfProportion](./emfproportion) | The Proportion enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces. |
| [EmfRecordType](./emfrecordtype) | The RecordType enumeration defines values that uniquely identify EMF records. These values are provided in the Type field of each record. |
| [EmfRegionMode](./emfregionmode) | The RegionMode enumeration defines values that are used with EMR_SELECTCLIPPATH and EMR_EXTSELECTCLIPRGN, specifying the current path or a new region that is being combined with the current clip region. |
| [EmfSerifStyle](./emfserifstyle) | The SerifType enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces |
| [EmfSerifType](./emfseriftype) | The SerifType enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces. |
| [EmfStockObject](./emfstockobject) | The StockObject enumeration specifies the indexes of predefined logical graphics objects that can be used in graphics operations.The specific structures of stock objects are implementation-dependent; however, the properties of stock objects SHOULD be equivalent to the properties of explicitly created objects of the same type. These properties are specified where possible for the stock objects defined in this enumeration. |
| [EmfStretchMode](./emfstretchmode) | The StretchMode enumeration is used to specify how color data is added to or removed from bitmaps that are stretched or compressed. |
| [EmfStrokeVariation](./emfstrokevariation) | The StrokeVariation enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces. |
| [EmfWeight](./emfweight) | The Weight enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces. |
| [EmfXHeight](./emfxheight) | The XHeight enumeration defines values for one of the characteristics in the PANOSE system for classifying typefaces. |
