## EmfStockObject enumeration

The StockObject enumeration specifies the indexes of predefined logical graphics objects that can be used in graphics operations.The specific structures of stock objects are implementation-dependent; however, the properties of stock objects SHOULD be equivalent to the properties of explicitly created objects of the same type. These properties are specified where possible for the stock objects defined in this enumeration.

```csharp
public enum EmfStockObject
```
