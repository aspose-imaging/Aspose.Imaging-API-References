## WmfPostScriptCap enumeration

The PostScriptCap Enumeration defines line-ending types for use with a PostScript printer driver.

```csharp
public enum WmfPostScriptCap
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PostScriptNotSet | `-2` | Specifies that the line-ending style has not been set, and that a default style MAY [24] be used. |
| PostScriptFlatCap | `0` | Specifies that the line ends at the last point. The end is squared off. |
| PostScriptRoundCap | `1` | Specifies a circular cap. The center of the circle is the last point in the line. The diameter of the circle is the same as the line width; that is, the thickness of the line. |
