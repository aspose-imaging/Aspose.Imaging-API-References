## WmfBinaryRasterOperation enumeration

The BinaryRasterOperation Enumeration section lists the binary raster-operation codes. Raster operation codes define how metafile processing combines the bits from the selected pen with the bits in the destination bitmap.

```csharp
public enum WmfBinaryRasterOperation
```

## Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Black | `1` | 0, Pixel is always 0. |
| Notmergepen | `2` | DPon, Pixel is the inverse of the MERGEPEN color |
| Masknotpen | `3` | DPna, Pixel is a combination of the screen color and the inverse of the pen color. |
| Notcopypen | `4` | Pn, Pixel is the inverse of the pen color. |
| Maskpennot | `5` | PDna, Pixel is a combination of the colors common to both the pen and the inverse of the screen. |
| Not | `6` | Dn, Pixel is the inverse of the screen color. |
| Xorpen | `7` | DPx, Pixel is a combination of the colors in the pen or in the screen, but not in both. |
| Notmaskpen | `8` | DPan, Pixel is the inverse of the MASKPEN color. |
| Maskpen | `9` | DPa, Pixel is a combination of the colors common to both the pen and the screen. |
| Notxorpen | `10` | DPxn, Pixel is the inverse of the XORPEN color. |
| Nop | `11` | D, Pixel remains unchanged. |
| Mergenotpen | `12` | DPno, Pixel is a combination of the colors common to both the screen and the inverse of the pen. |
| Copypen | `13` | P, Pixel is the pen color. |
| Mergepennot | `14` | PDno, Pixel is a combination of the pen color and the inverse of the screen color. |
| Mergepen | `15` | DPo, Pixel is a combination of the pen color and the screen color. |
| White | `16` | 1, Pixel is always 1 |

### Remarks

Each raster-operation code represents a Boolean operation in which the values of the pixels in the selected pen and the destination bitmap are combined. Following are the two operands used in these operations. Operand Meaning P Selected pen D Destination bitmap a Bitwise AND n Bitwise NOT (inverse) o Bitwise OR x Bitwise exclusive OR (XOR)
