## WmfFamilyFont enumeration

The FamilyFont enumeration specifies the font family. Font families describe the look of a font in a general way. They are intended for specifying fonts when the exact typeface desired is not available.

```csharp
public enum WmfFamilyFont : byte
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dontcare | `0` | The default font is specified, which is implementation-dependent. |
| Roman | `1` | Fonts with variable stroke widths, which are proportional to the actual widths of the glyphs, and which have serifs. "MS Serif" is an example. |
| Swiss | `2` | Fonts with variable stroke widths, which are proportional to the actual widths of the glyphs, and which do not have serifs. "MS Sans Serif" is an example. |
| Modern | `3` | Fonts with constant stroke width, with or without serifs. Fixed-width fonts are usually modern. "Pica", "Elite", and "Courier New" are examples. |
| Script | `4` | Fonts designed to look like handwriting. "Script" and "Cursive" are examples. |
| Decorative | `5` | Novelty fonts. "Old English" is an example. |
