## WmfPostScriptClipping enumeration

The PostScriptClipping Enumeration defines functions that can be applied to the clipping path used for PostScript output.

| CLIP_RESTORE | `1` | Restores the PostScript clipping path to the last clipping path that was saved by a previous CLIP_SAVE function applied by a CLIP_TO_PATH record (section 2.3.6.6). |
