## WmfPostScriptClipping enumeration

The PostScriptClipping Enumeration defines functions that can be applied to the clipping path used for PostScript output.

```csharp
public enum WmfPostScriptClipping
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLIP_SAVE | `0` | Saves the current PostScript clipping path. |
| CLIP_RESTORE | `1` | Restores the PostScript clipping path to the last clipping path that was saved by a previous CLIP_SAVE function applied by a CLIP_TO_PATH record (section 2.3.6.6). |
| CLIP_INCLUSIVE | `2` | Intersects the current PostScript clipping path with the current clipping path and saves the result as the new PostScript clipping path. |
