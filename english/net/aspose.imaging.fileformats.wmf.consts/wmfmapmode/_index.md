## WmfMapMode enumeration

The map modes

```csharp
public enum WmfMapMode : short
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | `1` | The text Each logical unit is mapped to one device pixel. Positive x is to the right; positive y is down |
| Lometric | `2` | The lometric Each logical unit is mapped to 0.1 millimeter. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up. |
| Himetric | `3` | The himetric Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 millimeter. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up. |
| Loenglish | `4` | The loenglish Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up. |
| Hienglish | `5` | The hienglish Each logical unit is mapped to 0.001 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up. |
| Twips | `6` | The twips Each logical unit is mapped to one twentieth (1/20) of a point. In printing, a point is 1/72 of an inch; therefore, 1/20 of a point is 1/1440 of an inch. This unit is also known as a "twip". |
| Isotropic | `7` | The isotropic Logical units are mapped to arbitrary device units with equally scaled axes; that is, one unit along the x-axis is equal to one unit along the y-axis. The META_SETWINDOWEXT and META_SETVIEWPORTEXT records specify the units and the orientation of the axes. |
| Anisotropic | `8` | The anisotropic Logical units are mapped to arbitrary units with arbitrarily scaled axes. |
