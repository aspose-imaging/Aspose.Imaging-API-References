The GradientFill enumeration defines the modes for gradient fill operations.
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GRADIENT_FILL_RECT_H](#GRADIENT-FILL-RECT-H) | A mode in which color interpolation is performed along a gradient from the left to the right edges of a rectangle |
| [GRADIENT_FILL_RECT_V](#GRADIENT-FILL-RECT-V) | A mode in which color interpolation is performed along a gradient from the top to the bottom edges of a rectangle. |
| [GRADIENT_FILL_TRIANGLE](#GRADIENT-FILL-TRIANGLE) | A mode in which color interpolation is performed between vertexes of a triangleS |
