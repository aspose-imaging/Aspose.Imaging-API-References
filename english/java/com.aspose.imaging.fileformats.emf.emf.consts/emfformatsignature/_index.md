## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ENHMETA_SIGNATURE](#ENHMETA-SIGNATURE) | The value of this member is the sequence of ASCII characters "FME ", which happens to be the reverse of the string "EMF", and it denotes EMF record data. |
| [EPS_SIGNATURE](#EPS-SIGNATURE) | The value of this member is the sequence of ASCII characters "FSPE", which happens to be the reverse of the string "EPSF", and it denotes encapsulated PostScript (EPS) format data. |
### ENHMETA_SIGNATURE {#ENHMETA-SIGNATURE}
```
public static final int ENHMETA_SIGNATURE
```


The value of this member is the sequence of ASCII characters "FME ", which happens to be the reverse of the string "EMF", and it denotes EMF record data. Note The space character in the string is significant and MUST be present.

### EPS_SIGNATURE {#EPS-SIGNATURE}
```
public static final int EPS_SIGNATURE
```


The value of this member is the sequence of ASCII characters "FSPE", which happens to be the reverse of the string "EPSF", and it denotes encapsulated PostScript (EPS) format data.
