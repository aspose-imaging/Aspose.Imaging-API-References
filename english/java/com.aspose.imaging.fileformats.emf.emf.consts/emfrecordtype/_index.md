### EMR_BEGINPATH {#EMR-BEGINPATH}
```
public static final int EMR_BEGINPATH
```


This record opens a path bracket in the playback device context.

--------------------

After a path bracket is open, an application can begin processing records to define the points that lie in the path. An application MUST close an open path bracket by processing the EMR\_ENDPATH record. When an application processes the EMR\_BEGINPATH record, all previous paths MUST be discarded from the playback device context.

### EMR_CLOSEFIGURE {#EMR-CLOSEFIGURE}
```
public static final int EMR_CLOSEFIGURE
```


This record closes an open figure in a path.

--------------------

Processing the EMR\_CLOSEFIGURE record MUST close the figure by drawing a line from the current position to the first point of the figure, and then it MUST connect the lines by using the line join style. If a figure is closed by processing the EMR\_LINETO record instead of the EMR\_CLOSEFIGURE record, end caps are used to create the corner instead of a join. EMR\_LINETO is specified in section 2.3.5.13. The EMR\_CLOSEFIGURE record SHOULD only be used if there is an open path bracket in the playback device context. A figure in a path is open unless it is explicitly closed by processing this record. Note: A figure can be open even if the current point and the starting point of the figure are the same. After processing the EMR\_CLOSEFIGURE record, adding a line or curve to the path MUST start a new figure.
