### LCS_GM_GRAPHICS {#LCS-GM-GRAPHICS}
```
public static final int LCS_GM_GRAPHICS
```


Specifies that a colorimetric match SHOULD be maintained. Typically used for graphic designs and named colors. Intent: Proof ICC name: Relative Colorimetric

### LCS_GM_IMAGES {#LCS-GM-IMAGES}
```
public static final int LCS_GM_IMAGES
```


Specifies that contrast SHOULD be maintained. Typically used for photographs and natural images. Intent: Picture ICC name: Perceptual
