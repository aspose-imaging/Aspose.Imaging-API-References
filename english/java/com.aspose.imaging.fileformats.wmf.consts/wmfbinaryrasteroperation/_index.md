The BinaryRasterOperation Enumeration section lists the binary raster-operation codes. Raster operation codes define how metafile processing combines the bits from the selected pen with the bits in the destination bitmap.

--------------------

Each raster-operation code represents a Boolean operation in which the values of the pixels in the selected pen and the destination bitmap are combined. Following are the two operands used in these operations. Operand Meaning P Selected pen D Destination bitmap a Bitwise AND n Bitwise NOT (inverse) o Bitwise OR x Bitwise exclusive OR (XOR)
## Fields

| [Masknotpen](#Masknotpen) | DPna, Pixel is a combination of the screen color and the inverse of the pen color. |
| [Notcopypen](#Notcopypen) | Pn, Pixel is the inverse of the pen color. |
| [Maskpennot](#Maskpennot) | PDna, Pixel is a combination of the colors common to both the pen and the inverse of the screen. |
| [Not](#Not) | Dn, Pixel is the inverse of the screen color. |
| [Xorpen](#Xorpen) | DPx, Pixel is a combination of the colors in the pen or in the screen, but not in both. |
| [Notmaskpen](#Notmaskpen) | DPan, Pixel is the inverse of the MASKPEN color. |
| [Maskpen](#Maskpen) | DPa, Pixel is a combination of the colors common to both the pen and the screen. |
