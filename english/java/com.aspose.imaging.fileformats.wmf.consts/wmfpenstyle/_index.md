### Cosmetic {#Cosmetic}
```
public static final short Cosmetic
```


The cosmetic

### EndcapRound {#EndcapRound}
```
public static final short EndcapRound
```


The line end caps are round.

### JoinRound {#JoinRound}
```
public static final short JoinRound
```


Line joins are round.

### Solid {#Solid}
```
public static final short Solid
```


The pen is solid.

### Dash {#Dash}
```
public static final short Dash
```


The pen is dashed.

### Dot {#Dot}
```
public static final short Dot
```


The pen is dotted.

### Dashdot {#Dashdot}
```
public static final short Dashdot
```


The pen has alternating dashes and dots.

### Dashdotdot {#Dashdotdot}
```
public static final short Dashdotdot
```


The pen has dashes and double dots.

### Null {#Null}
```
public static final short Null
```


The pen is invisible.

### Insideframe {#Insideframe}
```
public static final short Insideframe
```


The pen is solid. When this pen is used in any drawing record that takes a bounding rectangle, the dimensions of the figure are shrunk so that it fits entirely in the bounding rectangle, taking into account the width of the pen.

### Userstyle {#Userstyle}
```
public static final short Userstyle
```


The pen uses a styling array supplied by the user.

### Alternate {#Alternate}
```
public static final short Alternate
```


The pen sets every other pixel (this style is applicable only for cosmetic pens).

### EndcapSquare {#EndcapSquare}
```
public static final short EndcapSquare
```


Line end caps are square.

### EndcapFlat {#EndcapFlat}
```
public static final short EndcapFlat
```


Line end caps are flat.

### JoinBevel {#JoinBevel}
```
public static final short JoinBevel
```


Line joins are beveled.

### JoinMiter {#JoinMiter}
```
public static final short JoinMiter
```


Line joins are mitered when they are within the current limit set by the SETMITERLIMIT META\_ESCAPE record. A join is beveled when it would exceed the limit.
