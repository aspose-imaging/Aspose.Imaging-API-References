### Solid {#Solid}
```
public static final int Solid
```


A brush that paints a single, constant color, either solid or dithered.

### Null {#Null}
```
public static final int Null
```


A brush that does nothing. Using a NULL brush in a graphics operation MUST have the same effect as using no brush at all

### Hatched {#Hatched}
```
public static final int Hatched
```


A brush that paints a predefined simple pattern, or "hatch", onto a solid background

### Pattern {#Pattern}
```
public static final int Pattern
```


A brush that paints a pattern defined by a bitmap, which MAY be a Bitmap16 Object or a DeviceIndependentBitmap (DIB) Object.

### Indexed {#Indexed}
```
public static final int Indexed
```


Not supported.

### Dibpattern {#Dibpattern}
```
public static final int Dibpattern
```


A pattern brush specified by a DIB.

### Dibpatternpt {#Dibpatternpt}
```
public static final int Dibpatternpt
```


A pattern brush specified by a DIB.

### Pattern8X8 {#Pattern8X8}
```
public static final int Pattern8X8
```


Not supported.

### Dibpattern8X8 {#Dibpattern8X8}
```
public static final int Dibpattern8X8
```


Not supported.

### Monopattern {#Monopattern}
```
public static final int Monopattern
```


Not supported.

### Gradient {#Gradient}
```
public static final int Gradient
```


The gradient Not suppoted in wmf, support in odg.
