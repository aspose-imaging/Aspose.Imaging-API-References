The map modes
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Text](#Text) | The text Each logical unit is mapped to one device pixel. |
| [Lometric](#Lometric) | The lometric Each logical unit is mapped to 0.1 millimeter. |
| [Himetric](#Himetric) | The himetric Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 millimeter. |
| [Loenglish](#Loenglish) | The loenglish Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 inch. |
| [Hienglish](#Hienglish) | The hienglish Each logical unit is mapped to 0.001 inch. |
| [Twips](#Twips) | The twips Each logical unit is mapped to one twentieth (1/20) of a point. |
| [Isotropic](#Isotropic) | The isotropic Logical units are mapped to arbitrary device units with equally scaled axes; that is, one unit along the x-axis is equal to one unit along the y-axis. |
| [Anisotropic](#Anisotropic) | The anisotropic Logical units are mapped to arbitrary units with arbitrarily scaled axes. |
### Text {#Text}
```
public static final short Text
```


The text Each logical unit is mapped to one device pixel. Positive x is to the right; positive y is down

### Lometric {#Lometric}
```
public static final short Lometric
```


The lometric Each logical unit is mapped to 0.1 millimeter. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.

### Himetric {#Himetric}
```
public static final short Himetric
```


The himetric Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 millimeter. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.

### Loenglish {#Loenglish}
```
public static final short Loenglish
```


The loenglish Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.

### Hienglish {#Hienglish}
```
public static final short Hienglish
```


The hienglish Each logical unit is mapped to 0.001 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive y is up.

### Twips {#Twips}
```
public static final short Twips
```


The twips Each logical unit is mapped to one twentieth (1/20) of a point. In printing, a point is 1/72 of an inch; therefore, 1/20 of a point is 1/1440 of an inch. This unit is also known as a "twip".

### Isotropic {#Isotropic}
```
public static final short Isotropic
```


The isotropic Logical units are mapped to arbitrary device units with equally scaled axes; that is, one unit along the x-axis is equal to one unit along the y-axis. The META\_SETWINDOWEXT and META\_SETVIEWPORTEXT records specify the units and the orientation of the axes.

### Anisotropic {#Anisotropic}
```
public static final short Anisotropic
```


The anisotropic Logical units are mapped to arbitrary units with arbitrarily scaled axes.
