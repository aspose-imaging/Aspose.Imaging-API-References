The CombineMode enumeration defines modes for combining two graphics regions. In the following descriptions, the regions to be combined are referred to as the "existing" and "new" regions.
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CombineModeReplace](#CombineModeReplace) | Replaces the existing region with the new region. |
| [CombineModeIntersect](#CombineModeIntersect) | Replaces the existing region with the intersection of the existing region and the new region. |
| [CombineModeUnion](#CombineModeUnion) | Replaces the existing region with the union of the existing and new regions. |
| [CombineModeXor](#CombineModeXor) | Replaces the existing region with the XOR of the existing and new regions. |
| [CombineModeExclude](#CombineModeExclude) | Replaces the existing region with the part of itself that is not in the new region. |
| [CombineModeComplement](#CombineModeComplement) | Replaces the existing region with the part of the new region that is not in the existing region. |

### CombineModeXor {#CombineModeXor}
```
public static final byte CombineModeXor
```
