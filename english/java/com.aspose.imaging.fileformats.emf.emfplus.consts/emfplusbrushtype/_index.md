The BrushType enumeration defines types of graphics brushes, which are used to fill graphics regions.
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BrushTypeSolidColor](#BrushTypeSolidColor) | Specifies a solid-color brush, which is characterized by an EmfPlusArgb value. |
| [BrushTypeHatchFill](#BrushTypeHatchFill) | Specifies a hatch brush, which is characterized by a predefined pattern. |
| [BrushTypeTextureFill](#BrushTypeTextureFill) | Specifies a texture brush, which is characterized by an image. |
| [BrushTypePathGradient](#BrushTypePathGradient) | Specifies a path gradient brush, which is characterized by a color gradient path gradient brush data. |
| [BrushTypeLinearGradient](#BrushTypeLinearGradient) | contains linear gradient brush data. |
