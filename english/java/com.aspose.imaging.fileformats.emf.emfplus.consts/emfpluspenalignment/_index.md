The PenAlignment enumeration defines the distribution of the width of the pen with respect to the line being drawn.

--------------------

Graphics pens are specified by [EmfPlusPen](../../com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.emf.emfplus.objects/emfpluspen) objects (section 2.2.1.7). Pen alignment can be visualized by considering a theoretical one-dimensional line drawn between two specified points. The pen alignment determines the proportion of pen width that is orthogonal to the theoretical line.
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PenAlignmentCenter](#PenAlignmentCenter) | Specifies that the EmfPlusPen object is centered over the theoretical line. |
| [PenAlignmentInset](#PenAlignmentInset) | Specifies that the pen is positioned on the inside of the theoretical line. |
| [PenAlignmentLeft](#PenAlignmentLeft) | Specifies that the pen is positioned to the left of the theoretical line. |
| [PenAlignmentOutset](#PenAlignmentOutset) | Specifies that the pen is positioned on the outside of the theoretical line. |
| [PenAlignmentRight](#PenAlignmentRight) | Specifies that the pen is positioned to the right of the theoretical line. |
