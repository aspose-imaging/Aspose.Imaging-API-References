The MetafileDataType enumeration defines types of metafiles data that can be embedded in an EMF+ metafile.

--------------------

Embedded metafile data is specified by EmfPlusMetafileData objects (section 2.2.2.27).
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [MetafileDataTypeWmf](#MetafileDataTypeWmf) | Specifies that the metafile is a WMF metafile that specifies graphics operations with WMF records, as specified in [MS-WMF]. |
| [MetafileDataTypeWmfPlaceable](#MetafileDataTypeWmfPlaceable) | Specifies that the metafile is a WMF metafile that specifies graphics operations with WMF records, and which contains additional header information that makes the WMF metafile device-independent, as specified in [MS-WMF]. |
| [MetafileDataTypeEmf](#MetafileDataTypeEmf) | Specifies that the metafile is an EMF metafile that specifies graphics operations with EMF records, as specified in [MS-EMF]. |
| [MetafileDataTypeEmfPlusOnly](#MetafileDataTypeEmfPlusOnly) | Specifies that the metafile is an EMF+ metafile that specifies graphics operations with EMF+ records only. |
| [MetafileDataTypeEmfPlusDual](#MetafileDataTypeEmfPlusDual) | Specifies that the metafile is an EMF+ metafile that specifies graphics operations with both EMF and EMF+ records. |
### MetafileDataTypeWmf {#MetafileDataTypeWmf}
```
public static final int MetafileDataTypeWmf

```
public static final int MetafileDataTypeEmfPlusDual
```


Specifies that the metafile is an EMF+ metafile that specifies graphics operations with both EMF and EMF+ records.
