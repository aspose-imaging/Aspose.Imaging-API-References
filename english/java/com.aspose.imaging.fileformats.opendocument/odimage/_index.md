| --- | --- | --- |
| streamContainer | [StreamContainer](../../com.aspose.imaging/streamcontainer) | The stream container. |

### getDefaultPage() {#getDefaultPage--}
```
public Image getDefaultPage()
```


Retrieves the default page associated with the image, providing essential access to the primary page within the image collection. This property streamlines navigation and manipulation of image data, enhancing the efficiency of software development workflows.

**Returns:**
[Image](../../com.aspose.imaging/image) - the default page.
### isCached() {#isCached--}
```
public boolean isCached()
```


Obtains a boolean value indicating whether the data of the object is currently cached, thus eliminating the need for data reading. This property serves as an optimization indicator, enhancing performance by minimizing redundant data access operation.

**Returns:**
boolean - a value indicating whether object's data is cached currently and no data reading is required.
### getBitsPerPixel() {#getBitsPerPixel--}
```
public int getBitsPerPixel()
```


Retrieves the count of bits per pixel for the image. This property provides insight into the level of detail and color depth represented in the image, aiding in various image processing tasks and optimizations.
