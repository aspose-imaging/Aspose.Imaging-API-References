The png compression level enum.
## Fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ZipLevel0](#ZipLevel0) | The data will be simply stored, with no change at all. |
| [ZipLevel1](#ZipLevel1) | The fastest but least effective compression. |
| [ZipLevel2](#ZipLevel2) | A little slower, but better, than level 1. |
| [ZipLevel3](#ZipLevel3) | A little slower, but better, than level 2. |
| [ZipLevel4](#ZipLevel4) | A little slower, but better, than level 3. |
| [ZipLevel5](#ZipLevel5) | A little slower than level 4, but with better compression. |
| [ZipLevel6](#ZipLevel6) | A little slower than level 5, but with better compression. |
| [ZipLevel7](#ZipLevel7) | Better compression than level 6, but even slower. |
| [ZipLevel8](#ZipLevel8) | Better compression than level 7, but even slower. |
| [ZipLevel9](#ZipLevel9) | The "best" compression, where best means greatest reduction in size of the input data stream. |
| [DeflateRecommended](#DeflateRecommended) | The most optimised compression, with a good balance of speed and compression efficiency. |
### ZipLevel0 {#ZipLevel0}
```
public static final int ZipLevel0
```


The data will be simply stored, with no change at all. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale.

### ZipLevel1 {#ZipLevel1}
```
public static final int ZipLevel1
```


The fastest but least effective compression. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale.

### ZipLevel2 {#ZipLevel2}
```
public static final int ZipLevel2
```


A little slower, but better, than level 1. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale.

### ZipLevel3 {#ZipLevel3}
```
public static final int ZipLevel3
```


A little slower, but better, than level 2. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale.

### ZipLevel4 {#ZipLevel4}
```
public static final int ZipLevel4
```


A little slower, but better, than level 3. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale.

### ZipLevel5 {#ZipLevel5}
```
public static final int ZipLevel5
```


A little slower than level 4, but with better compression. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale.

### ZipLevel6 {#ZipLevel6}
```
public static final int ZipLevel6
```


A little slower than level 5, but with better compression. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale.

### ZipLevel7 {#ZipLevel7}
```
public static final int ZipLevel7
```


Better compression than level 6, but even slower. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale.

### ZipLevel8 {#ZipLevel8}
```
public static final int ZipLevel8
```


Better compression than level 7, but even slower. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale.

### ZipLevel9 {#ZipLevel9}
```
public static final int ZipLevel9
```


The "best" compression, where best means greatest reduction in size of the input data stream. This is also the slowest compression. Uses a slower deflate implementation with a compression scale.

### DeflateRecommended {#DeflateRecommended}
```
public static final int DeflateRecommended
```


The most optimised compression, with a good balance of speed and compression efficiency. Uses a faster deflate implementation with no compression scale.
