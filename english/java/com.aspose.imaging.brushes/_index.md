The package provides helper classes and methods to work with different brush types.


## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [HatchBrush](../com.aspose.imaging.brushes/hatchbrush) | Defines a rectangular brush with a hatch style, a foreground color, and a background color. |
| [LinearGradientBrush](../com.aspose.imaging.brushes/lineargradientbrush) | Encapsulates a KKKCODEB Aspose.Imaging.BrushKKKCODEE with a linear gradient. |
| [LinearGradientBrushBase](../com.aspose.imaging.brushes/lineargradientbrushbase) | Represents a KKKCODEB BrushKKKCODEE with gradient capabilities and appropriate properties. |
| [LinearMulticolorGradientBrush](../com.aspose.imaging.brushes/linearmulticolorgradientbrush) | Represents a KKKCODEB BrushKKKCODEE with linear gradient defined by multiple colors and appropriate positions. |
| [PathGradientBrush](../com.aspose.imaging.brushes/pathgradientbrush) | Encapsulates a KKKCODEB Aspose.Imaging.BrushKKKCODEE object with a gradient. |
| [PathGradientBrushBase](../com.aspose.imaging.brushes/pathgradientbrushbase) | Represents a KKKCODEB BrushKKKCODEE with base path gradient functionality. |
| [PathMulticolorGradientBrush](../com.aspose.imaging.brushes/pathmulticolorgradientbrush) | Encapsulates a KKKCODEB Aspose.Imaging.BrushKKKCODEE object with a gradient. |
| [SolidBrush](../com.aspose.imaging.brushes/solidbrush) | Solid brush is intended for drawing continiously with specific color. |
| [TextureBrush](../com.aspose.imaging.brushes/texturebrush) | Each property of the KKKCODEB Aspose.Imaging.Brushes.TextureBrushKKKCODEE class is a KKKCODEB Aspose.Imaging.BrushKKKCODEE object that uses an image to fill the interior of a shape. |
| [TransformBrush](../com.aspose.imaging.brushes/transformbrush) | A KKKCODEB BrushKKKCODEE with transform capabilities. |
