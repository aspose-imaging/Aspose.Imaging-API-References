```
public final class PathGradientBrush extends PathGradientBrushBase
```

Encapsulates a `Aspose.Imaging.Brush` object with a gradient. This class cannot be inherited.

The center color is white by default. A user can changed this value at any time later.

The surround colors array is initialized by single element containing white color by default. The surround colors may be changed later, however at least single element is required when setting up the surround colors.

See the `Blend` for more details about its initialization.
