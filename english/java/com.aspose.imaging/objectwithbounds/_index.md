### ObjectWithBounds() {#ObjectWithBounds--}
```
public ObjectWithBounds()
```


### getBounds() {#getBounds--}
```
public abstract RectangleF getBounds()
```


Gets the object's bounds.

**Returns:**
[RectangleF](../../com.aspose.imaging/rectanglef) - The object's bounds.
### getBounds(Matrix matrix) {#getBounds-com.aspose.imaging.Matrix-}
```
public abstract RectangleF getBounds(Matrix matrix)
```


Gets the object's bounds.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| matrix | [Matrix](../../com.aspose.imaging/matrix) | The matrix to apply before bounds will be calculated. |

**Returns:**
[RectangleF](../../com.aspose.imaging/rectanglef) - The estimated object's bounds.
### getBounds(Matrix matrix, Pen pen) {#getBounds-com.aspose.imaging.Matrix-com.aspose.imaging.Pen-}
```
public abstract RectangleF getBounds(Matrix matrix, Pen pen)
```


Gets the object's bounds.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| matrix | [Matrix](../../com.aspose.imaging/matrix) | The matrix to apply before bounds will be calculated. |
| pen | [Pen](../../com.aspose.imaging/pen) | The pen to use for object. This can influence the object's bounds size. |

**Returns:**
[RectangleF](../../com.aspose.imaging/rectanglef) - The estimated object's bounds.
### transform(Matrix transform) {#transform-com.aspose.imaging.Matrix-}
```
public abstract void transform(Matrix transform)
```


Applies the specified transformation to the shape.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| transform | [Matrix](../../com.aspose.imaging/matrix) | The transformation to apply. |
